; The lower the value, the more precise spotter will be, but the higher CPU usage will be.
; Valid range [0.0, 0.5].  At the lowest value, which is 0.0 (data updated on every frame), perf impact is approximately 10% FPS.
; At 0.1-0.2 it is negligible.
; Put this to 0.5 to completely eliminate FPS impact or if you do not use spotter.
