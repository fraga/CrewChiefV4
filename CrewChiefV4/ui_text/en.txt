# to change the name of the property title in the properties screen, just use the property name like this:
# enable_spotter = Enable spotter
# If you uncomment this line, the property text for enable_spotter will display "Enable spotter"
# Note that I've not (yet...) done this - I'm just using the property ID
#
# ---- Property filtering ----
# Properties form is capable of filtering properties per game.
#
# In order to specify property filter, add entry [property_name]_filter = [filter].
# If property has no filter attached, it is considered to be common property.
# Filter can consist of semicolon separated GameEnum values.  Filter can be inclusive or exclusive.  Exclusive filter starts with '!'.
#
# Examples:
# To specify that property applies to rF2 and R3E (include filter):
#	my_prop_filter = RF2_64BIT;RACE_ROOM
#
# To specify that property applies to all games but rF1 and AC (exclude filter):
#	my_prop_filter = !RF1;ASSETTO_64BIT;ASSETTO_32BIT
#
# ---- Property Categories ----
# Properties can also be assigned one or multiple categories.  The intent is to help  users discover features and options.
# The reason multiple categories are allowed is because it makes sense for some properties, and again increases discoverability.
# If no category is assigned, property gets MISC (Miscellaneous) category.
#
# Category is specified by:
#	my_prop_category = CATEGORY_NAME
#
# Where CATEGORY_NAME is one of the values in PropertiesForm.PropertyCategory enumeration.
