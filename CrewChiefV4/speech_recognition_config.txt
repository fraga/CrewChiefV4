# This file contains default options and mappings for the speech recogniser, ***** and will be overwritten when the app is updated *****.
#
# The mappings in here can be overridden by creating another file called "speech_recognition_config.txt" and placing this in
# [user]/AppData/local/CrewChiefV4/
#
# Any mappings in that file will replace the corresponding default here - note that they won't be added, they're be replaced.
# So if you create this file with a single line:
# HOWS_MY_TYRE_WEAR = tire wear
# the existing mappings for HOWS_MY_TYRE_WEAR will be removed, so the app will only recognise this new phrase.
# You only need to add mappings when you want to override the default - the app will gather up the defaults first,
# and replace any which are also in the override file.


# These phrases are all in English so can be loaded by any of the English speech recognition language packs. If this
# file is translated to a different language, this setting must match the ISO language code of the phrases in this file -
# e.g. 'en' for English, 'fr' for French, 'de' for German, etc. It *may* be possible to set a language code that doesn't
# match the language of the phrases in this file but this doesn't usually work
language = en

# the original name of this property was defaultLocale. It's still here just for backwards compatibility

# WHATS_THE_AIR_TEMP = ow 'ot is it:is it cowd:nice out:tell me the air temp or else
