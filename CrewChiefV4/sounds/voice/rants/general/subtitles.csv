4_male.wav,"well that went well, we're all properly thrilled that you stayed up half the night getting hammered while we worked on the car, just so we could watch you screw it all up in a hungover haze, well done, man"
5.wav,"right this, this isn't good enough, not by a long shot. I'm starting to wonder why we're bothering here. There's guys finishing way ahead of us who've got half the budget and cars that barely work. You're the weak link. The results are not gonna improve unless you do"
