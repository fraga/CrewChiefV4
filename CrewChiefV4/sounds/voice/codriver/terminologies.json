#
# This file allows the fine tuning of co-driver behavior.  For each corner calling style, additional mappings of
# pacenote type to sound folder is allowed.
#
# Mappable (and chainable) pacenote types are listed CrewChiefV4\CrewChiefV4\Events\CoDriver.cs in the PacenoteType enumeration.
#
# Example:
#  "NUMBER_FIRST": {
#     "terminology": {
#        "corner_1_left": "corner_hairpin_left",
#
# Above mapping means: For “Number First” style, “corner_1_left” ID coming from the game, play folder "corner_hairpin_left".
# Note that left side of the mapping has to be one of the PacenoteType enumeraton’s values, but right side can be anything.
#
# Additionally, this file allows specifying which PacenoteType IDs can be chained.  Chained ID means two things:
#
#   • If chained ID (for example Y) is close to the previous note (for example, X) (exact distance is configurable in the CC preferences),
#     it will be played in a chained note style, like “X into Y”.
#
#   • Also, only chained IDs are participating in a distance call calculations.  If the call following a distance call is not part of
#     the chainedTypes list, it is ignored.
#
# This file can be overridden my placing your own “terminologies.json” file into [Documents]\CrewChiefV4\ folder.
# When editing this file, make sure to review the console output for “Corrupted terminology” messages, as CC tries to
# ensure that file is authored correctly.
