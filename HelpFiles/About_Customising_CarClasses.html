      <h4>Why would I want to customise car classes?</h4>
      The main reason for caring about car classes in Crew Chief is to
      have a good Crew Chief experience for vehicle classes in mods that Crew Chief <i>does
        not support out of the box</i>. Crew Chief uses the Class definition for
      information about wheel sizes, brake types etc. There's a lot of
      awesome 3rd party content, but not all use the class names and the
      Crew Chief team can't cover them all. That's where this mechanism becomes
      helpful.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Verdana,

      <h4>Single-class vs Multi-class event</h4>
      Crew Chief uses Car Class to distinguish between multi-class and
      single-class races. If race is a multi-class race, Crew Chief will compare
      your lap times with lap times of vehicles of the&nbsp;same class.
      The problem is that sometimes mods are authored in a way that the
      car class name is different for vehicles in the same class. For
      example, there might be "A GT3" class name for vehicle of brand A,
      and "B GT3" for vehicle of brand B. If you would like Crew Chief
      to treat both as the same class you will need to map "A GT3" and
      "B GT3" class names to Crew Chief GT3 class. That way, such a race becomes
      a single class race.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);

      <h4>What can be customised using this mechanism?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Mapping a vehicle to a pre-defined Crew Chief class. For example, if
          your vehicle class is "Super Mod GT3", you can map it to GT3
          class.</li>
        <li>You can customise the pre-defined Crew Chief car classes. For
          example, if you are driving a vehicle with very large wheels,
          Crew Chief might announce that you're locking your wheels all the time
          (because the wheel rotates way slower than we expect). This
          Car Class configuration mechanism allows you to specify wheel
          sizes.</li>
