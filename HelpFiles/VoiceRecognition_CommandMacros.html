      The app can send sequences of key presses in response to voice
      command or a button / key press. These can be used for anything you like, but their
      primary function is to ease the pain of navigating the awkward
      in-game pit menus. The app comes with a default set of command
      macros which for AMS2, iRacing, PCars2 and Raceroom. The default commands can
      be found in [install folder]/saved_command_macros.json. The app
      includes a macro edit function which allows existing macros to be
      customised and new ones created. This will create a file
      Documents/CrewChiefV4/save_commands_macros.json with the macros
      you've modified or created, and will override the default file.<br>
      <br>
      Because macros are pretty simple (sending a pre-defined sequence
      of keys) you need to ensure the in-game key bindings match what
      the macro is expecting.<br>

      You can request a pit stop by saying "pit request", "in this lap"
      or "box this lap". This will open the pit menu, select 'pit
      request' and close it again after a few seconds' delay (so you can
      see what's selected).<br>
      <br>
      You can also cycle pit presets with the voice commands "next
      strategy", "next pit preset", "previous strategy", "previous pit
      preset".<br>
      <br>
      If you want to manually navigate the pit menu with voice commands,
      use "pit menu toggle", "pit menu up", "pit menu down", "pit menu
      left", "pit menu right" and "pit menu select".<br>
      <br>
      There are more sophisticated macros that can handle refuelling
      ("fuel to the end" and "add fuel, X litres"). They work by moving
      the pit menu to the fuel item, de-selecting 'fuel' and then
      changing the amount to zero by pressing 'Pit menu Decrease' many
      (about 100) times. They then press 'Pit menu Increase' the correct
      number of times to set the required (or calculated) fuel amount.
      Because many key presses are sent in quick succession, some users
      my encounter issues with these macros (but I've not had any
      problems myself) - it takes a few seconds to complete these macros
      to ensure you do them in plenty of time, before you reach the pit
      lane.<br>

      You can change the black boxes by saying one of the following
      commands: "black box lap time", "black box standings", "black box
      relative",<br>
      "black box fuel", "black box tires", "black box tire info", "black
      box pit stop", "black box car", "black box mirror" or "black box
      radio"<br>
      <br>
      You can navigate them by saying one of the following commands:
      "menu next", "menu previous", "menu increase", "menu decrease" or
      "menu toggle"<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Advanced command macros</h3>
      As you can see from the previous section, key press macros are
      fiddly and a bit dumb - the app has only limited knowledge of what
      state the pit menu is in so it has to either make assumptions or
      work quite hard to put the menu into a known state.<br>
      <br>
      There are 2 macros for adding fuel. One uses the logic of the
      app's 'Fuel' event to calculate how much fuel is needed to finish
      the race ("fuel to the end" voice command), the other uses the
      amount of fuel requested in the voice command ("add fuel, 100
      litres" or whatever). These macros opens the pit menu, navigate to
      the fuel option and attempt to reset it to zero litres. Because
      they can't know how much fuel might already be set on this menu
      they have to press the 'decrease' button lots (150) times. This
      ensure it's at zero before they then add the calculated or
      requested amount of fuel.<br>
      <br>
      *<i>Note that these will only work correctly if you use Litres as
        your unit.</i><br>
      <br>
      Another point to note here is that these fuelling macros press
      'decrease' 150 times quite quickly to ensure the fuel amount is
      zero before they start increasing it. When things are configured
      correctly it works well, but it's a lot of key presses and if
      something goes wrong the end result may be undesirable.<br>
      <br>
      The macro feature can also be used to automate chat messages.
      There are examples for pCars2 and R3E. Again, these just send
      sequences of key presses.<br>
      <br>
      There are a few special key press commands in the macro editor
      screen to help ease the pain of wiring these things up:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;- To send a fixed number of multiple key presses use "<b>{MULTIPLE,153}KEY_A</b>"
      (presses the A key 153 times).<br>
      &nbsp;- To send a number of multiple key presses based on some app
      logic for example, use "<b>{MULTIPLE,fuel}KEY_D</b>" (presses D
      however many times the Fuel event told it to). This requires
      specific application code to work but I'm happy to take requests
      :).<br>
      &nbsp;- To send a number of multiple presses based on the voice
      command that triggered the macro, the voice command needs to use a
      special format with the number range to recognise in curly braces
      - e.g. "<b>add fuel, {1,150} litres</b>" (recognises "add fuel 0
      litres" up to "add fuel 150 litres", in steps of 1). Use "<b>{MULTIPLE,VOICE_TRIGGER}KEY_D</b>"
      to press (in this example) D the number of times recognised in the
      voice command.<br>
      &nbsp;- To send a sequence of key presses from some free text, use
      "<b>{FREE_TEXT}sorry, my bad</b>". Each of the keys after <b>{FREE_TEXT}</b>
      will be pressed in sequence. Only letters, commas, hypens and
      full-stops are supported. This is to make chat macros more
      straightforward (e.g. <b>["Real-time Chat", "{FREE_TEXT}good
        pass", "ENTER"]</b>).<br>
      <br>
      Hopefully the game devs will make these menus or the actions they
      trigger easier to use for 3rd party apps. But until they do, these
      complicated automated interactions are always going to be flaky.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>R3E Pit Menu Interactions</h3>
      R3E exposes some additional information describing the state of
      the popup pit menu - I use this where I can to make the macros a
      little more reliable. The app is also able to navigate the menu by
      pressing sequences of key to make specific pit requests. This
      depends on the in-game key bindings matching the keys set up in
      the app's command macros. By default, these macros require the
      in-game pit menu actions to be bound to W (menu up), A (menu left
      / decrease), S (menu down), D (menu right / increase), Q (menu
      toggle), E (menu select) and R (request pit). It uses the menu
      navigation command macros (single button presses to move the
      cursor) to locate and select the approprate commands for most
      actions like selecting / deselecting tyres and repairs. Choosing a
      refuelling amount is not possible with this new approach - it
      still relies on the auto fuelling macros. The commands which use
      this new approach are:<br>
      <br>
      "pitstop clear tyres" / "pitstop don't change tyres" / "box, clear
      tyres" / "box, don't change tyres"<br>
      "pitstop change all tyres" / "box, change all tyres"<br>
      "pitstop change front tyres only" / "box, change front tyres only"<br>
      "pitstop change rear tyres only" / "box, change rear tyres only"<br>
      "pitstop fix front aero only" / "box, fix front aero only"<br>
      "pitstop fix rear aero only" / "box, fix rear aero only"<br>
      "pitstop fix all aero" / "box, fix all aero"<br>
      "pitstop don't fix aero" / "box, don't fix aero"<br>
      "pitstop fix suspension" / "box, fix suspension"<br>
      "pitstop don't fix suspension" / "box, don't fix suspension"<br>
      "pitstop serve penalty" / "box, serve penalty"<br>
      "pitstop don't serve penalty" / "box, don't serve penalty"<br>
      "pitstop refuel" / "box, refuel"<br>
      "pitstop don't refuel" / "box, don't refuel"<br>
      "what are the pit actions" / "what's the pitstop plan" (reports
      the selected actions for the next pitstop)<br>
      <br>
      The app will also read out the planned pit actions automatially
      when you get near the pit entrance after requesting a stop.<br>
