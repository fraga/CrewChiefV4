      <h3>Choosing Audio methods</h3>
      Crew Chief offers the choice of using <b>nAudio </b>instead of
      the standard Windows audio library.&nbsp; There are two Properties
      for selecting the audio method:<br>
      <h4>Use nAudio for playback</h4>
      Recommended. Using nAudio for playback allows device selection and
      higher volumes. It can also play messages in stereo.<br>
      <i>However, </i>nAudio has been known to cause some issues so
      it's worth disabling it if Crew Chief is misbehaving.<br>
      <br>
      nAudio offers two output interface types - <b>WaveOut </b>and <b>WASAPI</b>.
      WaveOut is more compatible, but WASAPI is more responsive/direct
      playback.<br>
      <br>
      If not using nAudio for playback you might need to change your
      default sound 'playback' device in the Windows Control Panel so
      Crew Chief sends audio to the right device. Windows 10 also
      includes the option to route audio from a specific application to
      a chosen output device.<br>
      <h4>Use nAudio for speech recognition</h4>
      Not recommended. It allows speech recognition device selection but
      voice recognition <b>Trigger word</b> and <b>Press and release
        button</b> are not available with nAudio. Also Crew Chief works
      better if this setting is disabled and instead your preferred
      microphone is set as the default sound recording device in the
      Windows sounds Control Panel.<br>
