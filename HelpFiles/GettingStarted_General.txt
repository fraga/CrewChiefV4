<h3>Quick start</h3>
Crew Chief requires the .Net framework, version 4.6. This is included in Windows 10 but Windows 7 and Window 8 users will need to install it.

Download the CrewChiefV4.msi installer and run it.<br> Start the app. Click the "Download sound pack" button and the "Download driver names" button to get the latest sounds and driver names. Select a game from the list at the top right. When the sounds and driver names have finished downloading, click the "Start Application" button. Then fire up the game. Note that the app comes with swearing 'off' by default - if you want to be sworn at you need to enable this in the Properties UI.

When you first start Crew Chief the app will be installed with no sounds. The UI should have 2 big buttons, highlighted in green. Pressing these will download the sound pack (voice messages) and optional (but highly recommended) driver names. Press them both and when they're both complete, you'll be prompted to restart the application.

For Raceroom and Project Cars, Crew Chief is self contained and needs no other software and almost no configuration. For rFactor 1 based games, rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa there are a couple of extra steps required. 

For voice recognition (entirely optional but quite handy and very cool) see below.
<h3>Startup issues</h3>
If the app refuses to start, or starts then closes itself, try deleting the app's configuration files. To do this go to C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Local\Britton_IT_Ltd\ and delete all the subfolders in there. This will reset all the app's settings to default. Note that the 'AppData' folder is hidden by default on Windows - you may need to change the View settings in the File Explorer Options from Windows Control Panel - look for a setting called "Show hidden files and folders".

There may also be an error logged in the Windows Event logs - look for .Net errors in the Application Logs section.
