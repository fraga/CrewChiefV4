      There are some known issues which aren't fixable<br>
      <br>
      <b>Project Cars</b> doesn't send opponent laptime data, so Crew
      Chief has to time their laps. In practice and qual sessions this
      is fairly reliable (because Crew Chief can use the time remaining
      in the session, sent by the game, for its 'clock' when timing). In
      race sessions with a fixed number of laps Crew Chief has nothing
      it can use as a clock to time the laps, so times them itself. This
      can lead to opponent lap / sector time inaccuracies if the player
      pauses the game (Crew Chief's clock is still running).
      <br>
      Joining a session part way through (practice or qualify session
      online) will result in Crew Chief having an incomplete set of data
      for opponent lap and sector times. In such cases the best opponent
      lap and sector data is inaccurate. For <b>Project Cars</b>,
      there's nothing I can do about this. The opponent lap and sector
      times aren't in the shared memory (Crew Chief has to time their
      laps), so the pace and sector delta reports may be inaccurate
      (they use the fastest lap completed while Crew Chief is running).
      For Raceroom we can get the fastest opponent lap time, but if this
      lap was completed before Crew Chief was running, the sectors
      within that lap aren't accessible. In this case the pace report
      will include the lap time delta, but there'll be no sector delta
      reports.<br>
      <br>
      In both cases as soon as an opponent sets a faster lap, Crew Chief
      will have up to date best lap data so the pace and sector reports
      will be accurate and complete.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Project Cars</b> doesn't send opponent car class data, so Crew
      Chief has to assume that all drivers in the race are in the same
      car class. For multiclass races, all pace and other reports will
      be relative to the overall leader / fastest car.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Project Cars</b> doesn't have a distinct pre-start procedure
      phase. I've added some more messages before the 'get ready' but
      there's a risk here that they might delay the 'get ready' message.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>RaceRoom</b> uses a 'slot_id' field to uniquely identify
      drivers in a race. However, this field doesn't really work
      properly (there are lots of issues with it), so Crew Chief has to
      use the driver's names. Driver names for AI driver are not unique.
      All the lap time and other data held for each driver is indexed by
      driver name so if a race has 2 or more drivers with the same name,
      Crew Chief will get things like lap and sector times wrong. This
      is only a problem racing the AI - be aware that if you have a car
      class with a limited number of unique AI drivers (Daytona
      Prototypes / German Nationals / Americal Nationals / Hill Climb
      Legends / etc), but select a field size greater than this, Crew
      Chief will do weird things.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>RaceRoom</b> doesn't have a pre-start procedure phase for
      offline races, and in the pre-start phase online ("Gridwalk") very
      little valid and accurate data is available.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Detecting 'good' passes</b> isn't really feasible. I've tried
      to limit the 'good pass' messages to overtakes that are reasonably
      'secure', don't result in the other car slowing excessively, and
      don't involve the player going off-track. I can't, for example,
      tell the difference between a clean pass and a bump-and-run punt,
      so you might get congratulated for driving like a berk.
