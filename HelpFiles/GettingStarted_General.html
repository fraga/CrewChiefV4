<h3>Quick start</h3>
Crew Chief requires the .Net framework, version 4.6. This is included in Windows 10 but Windows 7 and Window 8 users will need to install it.<br>
<br>
Download the CrewChiefV4.msi installer <a href="http://thecrewchief.org/forum.php">via the forum</a> and run it.<br>
Start the app. Click the <b>Download sound pack</b> button and the <b>Download driver names</b> button to get the latest sounds and driver names. Select a game from the list at the top right. When the sounds and driver names have finished downloading, click the <b>Start Application</b> button. Then fire up the game. Note that the app comes with swearing 'off' by default - if you want to be sworn at you need to enable this in the Properties UI.<br>
<br>
For Raceroom, iRacing and Project Cars, Crew Chief is self contained and needs no other software and almost no configuration. For rFactor 1 based games, rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa there are a couple of extra steps required.<br>
<br>
For voice recognition (entirely optional but quite handy and very cool) see below.<br>
<h3>Startup issues</h3>
If the app refuses to start, or starts then closes itself, try deleting the app's configuration files. To do this go to C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Local\Britton_IT_Ltd\ and delete all the subfolders in there. This will reset all the app's settings to default. Note that the 'AppData' folder is hidden by default on Windows - you may need to change the View settings in the File Explorer Options from Windows Control Panel - look for a setting called <b>Show hidden files and folders</b>.<br>
<br>
There may also be an error logged in the Windows Event logs - look for .Net errors in the Application Logs section.<br>
