      Crew Chief includes a rather rudimentary preferences screen accessed
      by the <b>Properties</b> button. Many many aspects of Crew Chief's
      behaviour can be customised here but it's important to note that
      you don't <i>have </i>to make any changes to these properties to
      get Crew Chief to work correctly - the defaults are sensible settings
      and Crew Chief doesn't <i>need </i>any configuration (except for
      swearing - see <b>Speech/Swearing</b>).<br>
      <br>
      We've added a search capability to the window. Most of Crew Chief options
      apply to all simulators, but you can also search for game specific
      preferences by typing ACS, AMS, R3E, rF1, rF2 or pCars to filter
      accordingly.<br>
