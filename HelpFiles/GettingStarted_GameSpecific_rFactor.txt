Automobilista / RF1 / Game Stock Car Extreme / Formula Truck / Copa Petrobras de Marcas:

You need Dan Allongo's plugin for these games. The app will check if this plugin is installed in the correct game folder. If it isn't, the app will offer to install it for you when you start the app with Automobilista / RF1 / Game Stock Car Extreme / Formula Truck / Copa Petrobras de Marcas selected. In most cases all you need do is click the <b>OK</b> button in the popup.

If this process fails for any reason, copy the rFactorSharedMemoryMap.dll from the app's plugins folder - usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Britton IT Ltd\CrewChiefV4\plugins\rfactor1\Plugins\rFactorSharedMemoryMap.dll to the Automobilista / RF1 / Game Stock Car Extreme / Formula Truck / Copa Petrobras de Marcas 'Plugins' folder (usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Automobilista\Plugins). Once you've done this just select the game from Crew Chief's Game menu and press the Start button.

The source code for this plugin is <a href="https://github.com/dallongo/rFactorSharedMemoryMap">here</a>.
