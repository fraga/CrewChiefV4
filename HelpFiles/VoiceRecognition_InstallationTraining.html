    <div style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode';font-size:13px;"
      class="main"> There are two voice recognition systems which Crew
      Chief can use. <br>
      <ol>
	    <li>The default option is referred to as the "<font
            color="#009900"><b>Windows</b></font> speech recognition
          engine" and uses the speech recognition system built in to
          Windows. This requires a better quality voice input signal
          than the default system but can be trained to recognise a
          user's individual voice. It does not require the installation
          of any additional components.</li>
        <li>The other option is referred to as the "<font
            color="#009900"><b>Microsoft</b></font> speech recognition
          engine" which is optimised for noisy environments and poor
          quality sound input. It requires no training and works with a
          wide range of microphone types and accents, but it requires a
          separate runtime installation and a language pack.</li>
      </ol>
      Which is best depends on the quality of your microphone, your
      voice, the amount of background noise, and countless other
      factors. It's worth trying both and seeing which gives the best
      results.<br>
      <br><br>
	  If you want to use the default <font color="#009900"><b>Windows</b></font>
      speech recognition engine simply ensure that the 'Prefer Windows
      speech recogniser' option is checked on the Properties screen. You
      will get better results if you work through the speech recognition
      training process in Windows.<br>
      <h4>Windows Speech Recognition on non-English Windows Installs</h4>
      If your Windows install isn't English, you may need to add the English language speech recognition files to your Windows install.<br><br>

      In Settings -> "Time and Language" click Language and add a language package - English (US) works well. Exit the Settings app and restart it, go back to Time and Language settings, then Speech. The language you just added should appear in the Speech Language drop down box, showing that it's available as a speech recognition language.<br><br>

      That should be sufficient - start Crew Chief and see if it works. You might need to select English (US) as you speech language in the Time and Language settings screen.<br><br>

      There's also a checkbox in the Speech settings for "Recognise non-native accents for this language". This may improve accuracy for some users.<br><br>

      Note that you don't have to change your display language to English<br><br><br>

      If you want to use the <font color="#009900"><b>Microsoft</b></font>
      voice recognition system, you'll need to install the Microsoft Speech
	  Recognition runtime
	  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=27225">SpeechPlatformRuntime.msi</a>.
	  From this page click 'Download' and select the right version - for most users
	  this will be x64_SpeechPlatformRuntime\SpeechPlatformRuntime.msi.
	  Alternative downloads containing this installer (and installers for the UK and US language packs) are
	  <a href="https://d1o4ya81faadx8.cloudfront.net/Speech_recognition_64bit.zip">here (64bit)</a> and 
	  <a href="https://d1o4ya81faadx8.cloudfront.net/Speech_recognition_32bit.zip">here (32bit)</a><br><br>
      Once you've installed this, you'll also need to install an English language pack. The official download
	  location for these is <a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=27224">here</a><br>
      Again, from this page click 'Download' and select the right
      version - for most users this will be MSSpeech_SR_en-US_TELE.msi
      (US users) or MSSpeech_SR_en-GB_TELE.msi (UK users).<br>
	  If this isn't available, these language packs are
	  also in the alternative download package linked above.<br><br>
      Note that Crew Chief will fall back to using the Microsoft speech
      recognition engine if it can't find a working installation of the
      Windows speech recognition engine.<br>
      <br>

      Crew Chief will use the "Default" recording device for voice
      recognition - this can be selected in the "Recording devices"
      section of the Window Sounds control panel.<br>
      (There is also the further choice of using nAudio for input but
      that is not recommended, but it does allow you can choose the
      recording device.)<br>
      <br>
      Voice recognition can be configured to be always-on (it listens
      continuously and responds when it recognises a command) or in
      response to a button press. To assign a button to a activate voice
      recognition see <a href="GettingStarted_ControlButtons.html">Getting

        Started: Control Buttons</a>. By default you have to hold this
      button down while you talk - this can be changed by selecting a
      different 'Voice recognition mode'.<br>
      <h4>Confidence Levels</h4>
      <p>The voice recognition system reports a "Confidence Level", indicating
	    how confident is is that it understood what you said.
		Crew Chief uses that to be sure that speech is intended as a
		and that Crew Chief interprets the command correctly. Crew Chief uses
		confidence thresholds to decide whether to reject a voice command which
		is recognised with too low a confidence value. The Microsoft and
        Windows speech recognition engines report different confidence values and
        Crew Chief also uses different threshold values for different situations
        (recognising the trigger word "Chief", recognising commands,
        recognising names) so there are 6 levels that can be adjusted if
        needed.&nbsp; Crew Chief shows the confidence level in the
        console window along with the relevant threshold property name and
		value when it recognises speech - e.g. <i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Microsoft
            recogniser heard keyword "Chief", waiting for command,
            confidence 0.986</font></i>.<br>
		By default, Crew Chief will modify the Confidence Level thresholds
		automatically, while running tuning them to better match the range of values reported
		by the speech recogniser (starting from the initial values set in the Properties screen).

      <h4>Testing voice recognition</h4>
      Having set it all up press the <b>Start Application</b> button in
      Crew Chief, then press your voice recognition button and ask "Can
      you hear me?". If Crew Chief can understand you it'll respond with
      "Yes, I can hear you".<br>
      <br>
      Make sure you test this while the game is running as some games
      claim exclusive control, so if no app is running that is claiming
      control it will always work.<br>
      <br>
      If it doesn't work: right click on the speaker on the taskbar,
      select Open Sound Settings then Sound Control Panel. In the
      Playback tab, select your playback device, then in the Properties
      / Advanced tab <i>uncheck</i> "Allow applications to take
      exclusive control of this device" Do the same for your microphone.<br>
      Also in the Communications Tab set "When Windows detects
      communication activity:" Do Nothing<br>
      <br>
