      class="main">Crew Chief continuously logs all kinds of infomation
      in its "Console window" and when Crew Chief exits it saves it all
      in a file in the folder <b><i>&lt;Documents&gt;</i></b><b>\CrewChiefV4\debugLogs</b>
      (for example c:\users\Documents\<i>&lt;your name&gt;</i>\CrewChiefV4\debugLogs).&nbsp;
      Each one has a timestamp in the name which is the date and time
      when it was saved (for example c:\users\Documents\<i>&lt;your
        name&gt;</i>\CrewChiefV4\debugLogs\console_<b><i>2022_03_23-20-12-26</i></b>.txt,
      <i>year_month_day-hour-minute-second</i>). It keeps the latest 25
      files, deleting older ones.<br>
      <br>
      You can also save a file at any time by right clicking on the
      Console window.<br>
      <br>
      If Crew Chief isn't working for you then the most important thing
      is to upload the log file that was saved after you saw a problem
      to either the forum, Discord or to the<a
href="mailto:contact-project+mr-belowski-crewchiefv4-9438945-issue-@incoming.gitlab.com">
        confidential email address</a> <br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> If Crew Chief crashes</b> the log file won't be saved but
      a previous one may help.<br>
