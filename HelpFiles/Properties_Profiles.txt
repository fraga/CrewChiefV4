CC saves a set of preferences and controller bindings into profile files saved in <b>My Documents\CrewChiefV4\Profiles</b> (.json files).
A profile can be loaded by activating it in the Properties window or from the command line <code>-profile <i>profile file name</i></code>.
A new profile can be created in the Properties window, if you check <b>Copy settings from current selected profile</b> the new profile will contain settings from currently active profile.
