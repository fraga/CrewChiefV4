      class="main">In the words of Jim Britton (aka Mr Belowski, the
      creator as well as the voice of Crew Chief) <i>"Back in 2015 I
        was playing Raceroom a lot and you had to decide between
        switching on these massive ugly overlays or having no fuel &amp;
        penalty information. While on holiday I was sitting in a sauna
        thinking about it and I decided to address those specific issues
        with a little radio app which called out penalties and a couple
        of other things. Really narrow scope initially but it grew
        quickly and the Raceroom community liked the idea. Suggestions
        for improvements started coming in and it grew from there.</i><i><br>
      </i><i><br>
      </i><i>At the time, the goal was to build something as good as the
        iRacing spotter / chief (which was and still is very good) so I
        had a lot of things to add. There was a V1, it was rubbish. I
        made it less rubbish by adding a crude UI and other things,
        calling it V2. This was late 2015. Then I added voice
        recognition and some other things in 2016 and called it V3 'cos
        it was much better. Then I made the auto updater and added a
        load of other stuff mid 2017 and called it V4. Then I realised
        that the auto updater code meant that changing it to V5 would
        create a lot of additional boring work that I didn't want to do,
        so it's been stuck at V4 ever since.</i><i><br>
        <br>
        In late 2015 Project Cars was the first game added, it required
        a major overhaul to decouple the game from Crew Chief's internal
        state.&nbsp; Other games were added later, more easily now that
        Crew Chief could handle them more like plug-ins.<br>
      </i><i><br>
      </i><i>If it had just been me working on it, there's no doubt it
        would have stayed rubbish. I'm incredibly grateful to the guys
        who've worked with me* on it </i><font size="-2">(See
        About/Credits)</font><i> and to the community for their ideas,
        support and encouragement. But 7 years... still boggles the
        mind!"<br>
