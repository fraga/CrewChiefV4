      <h4>Version 4.13.0.2<br>
      </h4>
      <p>&nbsp;* VR overlays: Fixed gazing. Added an option to change
        tracking space for overlays (Seated/Standing/Follow Head); <br>
        &nbsp;* Added an option to only use sounds which are
        gender-neutral. The app has, historically, assumed all players
        are male so contains lots of sounds with words like words like
        'man', 'guy', 'he' etc which is a bit silly. If you enable the
        'Block sounds which refer to drivers as male' property the app
        will only use sounds that are gender-neutral ('driver', 'car',
        etc). Note that this requires the latest sound pack update to
        work;<br>
        &nbsp;* RF2 - tweaked the behaviour of the pit manager system so
        it only inspects the pit menu layout when it's first invoked,
        rather than at the start of a session; Added an option to
        disable the pit menu manager ('enable rF2 pit manager'
        property); Fixed initialisation of pit menu manager<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Version 4.13.0.0:</h4>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;* <font color="#ff0000"><b>
    rFactor 2 now needs
    Vytautas Leonavi&#x010D;ius' rFactor 2 Plugin version 3.7.14.2
</b></font>&nbsp; It's part of this CC version and will be
        installed automatically but note that any other apps that use it
        will need to be updated<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* rFactor 2 - added voice control of pit menu,
        similar to that for iRacing and R3E<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Rally mode and support for Richard Burns
        Rally<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added rudimentary pCars3 support;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added support for controller 'point of view'
        buttons (should allow direction-pads to be used for button
        assignments)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* AMS2 - A few car class tweaks<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - added multi-class support<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Version 4.12.0.8:</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Corrected VR overlay default behaviour (should
        fix the remaining issues with the overlays)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* corrected app name being "5" on the Windows Sounds
        mixer (stupid fat-fingered typo, sorry)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* added "what's my oil temp" and "what's my water
        temp" voice commands<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - tweaked car class mapping for WTCR<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Version 4.12.0.7</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix for issues with VR overlay windows<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* corrected time deltas in multiclass racing on
        pCars2 / AMS2<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - fixed some missing tyre type mappings<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Version 4.12.0.6</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - fixed OtterHud integration<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Version 4.12.0.5:<br>
      </h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some UI tidying up and bug fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Stockcar Extreme - fix for app trying (and failing)
      to install plugin on every start (the plugin .dll must be install
      manually)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - download player rating data in background
      (should improve start up time)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCars / pCars2 - allow finer control over car class
      mapping using an optional pCarsCarNames field in the car classes
      JSON<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AMS2 - wired up a bit more of the existing pCars2
      logic (e.g. weather conditions)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added F1 2020 to games list (spotter only)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* fixed some VR integration bugs<br>
      <h4>Version 4.12.0.1:</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed SteamVR detection on non-English installs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some issues in speech recognition
      initialisation error handling<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix a crash bug preventing the app from starting
      when user-defined macros are incomplete<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow existing driver name (opponent name)
      recordings to be used to generate personalisations (note that
      these may sound a bit robotic - some will probably be fine, some
      will be unusable, most will be somewhere in between). If you're
      waiting for your name to be added to the app check the My Name
      list again - it might be available<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Tweaked the My Name list box so you can now type
      into it (this is needed because there are now about 8000 entries
      in this list)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to force VR overlay windows to be on
      top<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few minor bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.12.0.0:</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added support for Steam VR overlays. Enable this
      with the 'Enable VR overlays' property (the app can also start
      SteamVR if necessary by enabling the 'Start SteamVR if detected'
      property). This will enable the 'VR Settings' button on the main
      screen which opens a popup window allowing you to select which of
      your desktop windows to be rendered in VR. You can also move them
      around, scale them and other stuff from this menu. This supports
      any desktop window as well as the Crew Chief overlays (charts,
      console and subtitles). The app will remember your window config
      and reapply them when you next start it. If you want the VR
      overlays to be started with the app, enable the 'Enable VR
      overlays when app starts' property<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked help and documentation into proper HTML
      pages accessed from the app's toolbar menu<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Overhauled button handling to reduce delays and fix
      some issues<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some pace notes improvements - better multi-lap pace
      notes handling and add better audio feedback (pace notes specific
      voice message and a different radio beep when recording mode is
      enabled)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added feature to 'watch' opponents - use the voice
      command 'watch [opponent last name]', 'team mate [opponent last
      name]' or 'rival [opponent last name]' to mark a driver as
      watched. The app will give updates on watched drivers. The watch
      list can be cleared with the 'cancel watched drivers' command (or
      'stop watching [opponent name]' to remove a specific driver). Note
      that the watch list is cleared on session start so drivers watched
      in qualifying won't be on the watch list for the race (you need to
      re-add them)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - added support for R3E driver rating data. When
      approaching an opponent with low reputation you may get a warning
      about him. Opponents' ranking, rating and reputation can be
      accessed with the voice command 'whats [opponent last name]'s
      ranking / rating / reputation'<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - updated various vehicle classes and their tyre
      temperature thresholds and added Daytona track mapping (running on
      the oval should now activate the oval spotter and logic)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Various bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.11.1.2:</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked pace notes functionality to allow pace
      notes to be recorded over multiple laps and to add some speed and
      direction filtering (e.g. you might want a particular pace note to
      only play when the car is going too fast) - full documentation
      still to be done<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to make pace notes play automatically
      when starting a practice session (disabled by default, enable with
      'Play pace notes automatically in practice' property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to mute other messages when pace notes
      are playing (enabled by default, disable with 'Mute messages when
      playing pace notes' property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Improvements to the subtitle overlay<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Replaced existing 'fuel in gallons' property with
      more generic 'Use metric' property which applies to fuel and speed
      calls<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to disable pit speed limit warnings
      ('Enable pit speed limit warnings', defaults to enabled)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fix some pitstop commands<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AMS2 - fix command line wiring<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - fix broken opponent position messages when
      asking "where is [opponent name]"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - added some missing tyre types to the pit menu
      code<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - tweaked tyre wear warning messages so the app
      isn't as conservative<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - fix for broadcast API change<br>
      <h4>Version 4.11.0.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix some subtitle issues when using personalisations
      for some users<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow sounds to be played back in stereo when using
      nAudio for playback (enable with the "Play messages in stereo"
      property) - should fix cases where the app's sound only plays
      through one speaker<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - changed deprecation warning so it's just a
      console message rather than a popup<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Changed default subtitle overlay colour scheme (this
      can be changed manually by editing the
      Documents/CrewChiefV4/subtitle_overlay.json file - the recommended
      value for the "activeColorScheme" property is "CrewChief")<br>
      <h4>Version 4.11.0.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added subtitles. Subtitles can be shown as an
      overlay from Crew Chief (enable with the 'Enbable subtitle
      overlay' option in the Properties screen) or can be written to a
      shared memory file for use in 3rd party overlays or dashboards
      (enable with the 'Enable shared memory' option). See {sample} for
      an example project which uses this shared memory file. Massive
      thanks to Nolan Bates for a frankly astonishing amount of work
      transcribing all of Crew Chief's phrases<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Initial Automobilista 2 support (work in progress).
      To use this set the Shared Memory mode to Project Cars2 in the
      in-game System menu<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - removed pit window messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - added deprecation warning. We're stopping work
      on ACC support and might remove support entirely in the future<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* various bug fixes and tweaks<br>
      <h4>Version 4.10.0.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Better handling of corrupted settings files on
      startup<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Improved detection of on-track incidents<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - tweaked suspension damage thresholds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - improved session state detection when
      racing against AI<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fix pit limiter warnings<br>
      <h4>Version 4.10.0.8</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed a couple more start up crashes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix some queuing issues in more complex rally-style
      pace notes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - added Nurburgring corner mappings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - work around some odd behaviour in the pit menu
      for races with more than one pitstop<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few minor tweaks and fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.10.0.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed a couple of crash bugs on start up with broken
      profile settings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Tweaked pace notes feature to allow a set of sounds
      to trigger instead of a single sound (to better support complex
      rally-style pace notes)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - some AI session restart logic fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - updated some car class data<br>
      <h4>Version 4.10.0.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked cut track messages to make them more
      appropriate to how often you cut or violate track limits - note
      that if you cut persistently and frequently the app will
      (eventually) start to ignore these cuts<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - auto-select 'serve penalty' in the pit menu
      when you issue the 'box this lap' command with an outstanding
      penalty (requires the R3E pit menu key bindings to match the ones
      the app is expecting)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - fix crash bug caused by null or empty driver
      names when sending WebHud data<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - allow the app to manage disk telemetry
      handling (enable with 'Enable automatic telemetry disk recording'
      property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fix some issues with the track map on
      chart overlays<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - improved cut track detection<br>
      <h4>Version 4.10.0.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 plugin hotfix<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added track map to charts when zoomed in (uses car
      position data) - visible area is hightlighted in red<br>
      <h4>Version 4.10.0.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Chart controls hotfix<br>
      <h4>Version 4.10.0.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added overlays for console output and telemetry
      charts. See Overlays section in Help or Readme, or {detailed forum
      post} for more info<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some audio caching improvments<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* some minor tweaks and fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - new plugin<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.11.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix for app startup issues using nAudio where
      device names aren't unique<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.11.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked nAudio playback path to improve stability
      and fix some app shutdown issues<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* added option to play sounds using WASAPI output
      device when using nAudio playback (set with the 'nAudio Output
      Interface Type' property). This has significantly lower playback
      latency and can make the app sound more natural and responsive -
      definitely worth trying (remember to enable nAudio playback
      first). If the audio pops or crackles with this enable try
      increasing the 'nAudio WASAPI latency' property a bit<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to make the app respond to voice
      commands as soon as it recognises them in 'Hold Button' mode,
      rather than waiting until the radio button is released (enable
      this behaviour with the 'Respond to voice commands immediately'
      property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow closing CC from command line by passing C_EXIT
      command parameter<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - ensure penalties are cleared properly<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AC - some car class tweaks to better map GTE and GT3<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - more robust pit entry detection (should
      reduce the likelihood of the all not refuelling after a mess pit
      entry)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.10.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Prevent fuel consumption estimates being skewed by
      full course yellow flags<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked damage reporting logic to make it more
      natural<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some message queuing improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disable opponent pit exit position estimates during
      full course yellow flag<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow pace notes to play even when the app is in
      'keep quiet' mode<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Play a beep when releasing the radio button in 'Hold
      button' mode (disabled by default, enable with
      'enable_on_hold_close_channel_beep' property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* When spotter messages interrupt the chief or you
      press the radio button, any sound currently playing is interrupted
      immediately (only works with nAudio playback enabled and, for
      voice communication interrupting, 'Block messages when talking to
      the Chief' enabled)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix 'toggle mode' speech recognition button press
      issues caused by the app seeing multiple presses when activating
      speech recognition<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix nAudio device indexing when changing default
      devices<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - added driver stint time messages, more penalty
      messages and some other missing data<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* F1 2019 - use correct property value for UDP port
      (was using the value for the F1 2018 property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - improved detection of hot-lap qualifying
      sessions to prevent spurious spotter messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - fix missing tyre wear messages when multiplier
      is 2 or more<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - fix incorrect DRS messages<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.9.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Final hotfix (fingers crossed...) for the remaining
      speech recognition initialisation issues<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.9.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Another hotfix (sorry guys) - fix broken speech
      recognition with non-English versions of Windows, added more
      sanity checking for user profiles<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.9.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix - fall back to Microsoft speech recognition
      engine implementation if the System speech recognition engine
      doesn't have the required language support<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix - fix a crash bug when initialising the
      speech recognition system for nAudio users<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix - fix plugin location error<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.9.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked speech recognisers to allow it to use the
      built-in Windows speech recognition, which may benefit from being
      trained to you voice. To enable this, enable the 'Prefer Windows
      speech recogniser' option in the Properties screen<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added experimental free-text chat feature for
      Raceroom, pCars2 and iRacing only - enable with 'Enable free
      dictation chat messages' property. To use this you must have
      Windows speech recognition enabled and you'll need to delete
      Documents\CrewChiefV4\saved_command_macros.json before launching
      the app (so the app can add a couple of new macro definitions).
      Read what out you want to say as you would with any other command,
      starting with "chat" - e.g. "chat, hello everyone" or "chat, this
      is a test chat message". The app will start the chat by executing
      the "start chat message" macro which presses C (raceroom) or T
      (iRacing / pCars2), type in the recognised text after "chat", then
      end the chat by executing the "end chat message" macro (which just
      presses enter). Note that this may produce some weird results if
      the speech recogniser doesn't accurately interpret what you're
      saying<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added a voice command to disable most of the
      complaining messages for the remainder of the current session -
      "stop complaining" / "stop grumbling" / "f*** off". This will
      prevent the app berating you when you're doing badly, which may be
      useful in long sessions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Limit the number of times the app will complain at
      the player during a session (default is 50 times, configurable
      with 'Max complaints per session' property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed app crash when using pCars network data button
      assignments<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.24</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - fix stale opponents not being cleared from
      internal state (should fix incorrect incident calls when players
      disconnect)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - mapped corner positions for Spa and Barcelona,
      corrected Monza mapping<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - added missing WTCR 2019 class (this is now
      correctly grouped with WTCR 2018)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.22</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix for updates requiring 2 restarts in order to
      correctly load the user's settings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* ACC - fix various issues including multipler bugs,
      missing pit exit / entry messages, incorrect mandatory pit stop
      window messages, missing flag messages, missing track landmark
      mappings (not every track yet) and a few other bits and bobs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fixed a nasty bug where a particular set
      of unexpected car class data from the game could make the app
      unresponsive<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.20</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added F1 2019 support (spotter only)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Assetto Corsa Competizioni support. This is a
      work-in-progress - the studio is still working on the API and
      there are issues with some of the data and some features of the
      app don't yet work<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added properties profiles to allow sets of options
      to be saved and reloaded - different profiles can be created with
      different app configurations. These can be created and loaded on
      the Properties screen, and can also be loaded at app start time
      with a command line argument by specifying 'profile
      profile_file_name.json' in the shortcut (e.g. short-cut Target:
      "C:\Program Files (x86)\Britton IT
      Ltd\CrewChiefV4\CrewChiefV4.exe" profile some_profile.json)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow some properties to be modified without needing
      to restart the app<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed an issue with missing opponent gap data when
      the player is running 2nd<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to enable blue-flag messages ("Enable
      blue flag messages", defaults to enabled)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to limit the games show in the Crew
      Chief 'Games' list - to use this add a comma separated list of the
      games you want to be show to property 'Limit available games'.
      Most common versions and abbreviations of the game names should
      work here (e.g. "R3E, pCars2, Assetto, ACC, RF2")<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow radio beeps when the Chief talks to be
      switched off ("Enable radio beeps" properrty, defaults to enabled)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E: extended pit menu interactions - you can now
      ask for a specific tyre type in car classes that support it, for
      example "box, soft tyres" (see R3E Pit Menu Interactions)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.8</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix potential crash bug when assigning buttons or
      when testing button assignments / voice commands before the app
      receives any game data<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Removed some debug code that may have triggered in
      the previous release<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Rewrote installer to use WIX rather than
      InstallShield - should help with the updating issues that some
      users encounter<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added an optional delay before switching the spotter
      to be switched off on full course yellow (default is to silence
      spotter as soon as the full course yellow is shown - to use the
      new behaviour disable the 'Mute spotter immediately on full course
      yellow' property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - added latest Formula E mappings and rules
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - improved accuracy of pit box countdown<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Assign buttons when the button is released, not
      pressed. Should fix issues where continuously pressed buttons
      prevent button assignment from working<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - added ignore-blue-flags warnings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - added 'box, next tyre compound' voice command
      to cycle through available tyre types in the pit menu (see R3E Pit
      Menu Interactions section)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - added TireLoad data to WebHud export and
      incremented version number<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - corrected opponent tyre mapping for F1 and
      GroupC cars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - make use of pit menu data to provide more
      control over pit menu - added voice commands like "box, change
      front tyres only", and "box, don't fix aero". See R3E Pit Menu
      Interactions section here and in Help, or {detailed forum post}
      for more information<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few minor fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Prevent the app spamming the console window with
      errors when something fails on every tick (should prevent crashes
      when something goes wrong)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* In 'keep quiet' mode (e.g. after telling the app to
      "shut up") it really does keep quiet - even high priority messages
      are blocked - only the spotter messages continue to play (these
      can be blocked with the "don't spot" command). If you want the old
      behaviour back, where 'keep quiet' mode still allows high priority
      messages to play, enable the "Play important messages when
      silenced" option<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added a UI to add voice messages to the list of
      available button actions so you can easily assign a button to what
      would have been a voice command - press the 'Add / remove actions'
      button on the main screen to access this<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added some missing validation on the good / bad
      start messages<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed app hang when using Trigger Word speech
      recogntion with nAudio<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow nAudio speech recognition input device sample
      rate, bit depth and channel count to be set in Properties<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added some additional checks to prevent gap messages
      being played immediately after an overtake<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AC: don't load opponents into the speech recogniser
      once a race has started (should reduce CPU spikes in online races)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AC: fixed inaccurate laps-remaining data<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fixed some missing messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Various bug fixes and some code tidying up<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.8.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Start listening as soon as the radio channel button
      is pressed, instead of waiting for the beep to finish playing -
      should make the speech recognition a little easier to use<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - revised fuel calculations in races with
      driver swaps to use highest per-lap consumption - should fix
      refuelling being wildly inaccurate due to missing consumption data
      when your team mate is driving the car<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing &amp; R3E - extended the speech recogniser
      to include opponent car numbers - you can now ask for opponent
      data using car number, e.g. "what's car number 10's best lap
      time", or "where is car number ninety nine". To use this, enable
      the "Identify opponents by car number" property. Note that for
      iRacing car numbers may have leading zeros - in cases where a
      given number appears more than once in the session (with and
      without leading zeros), the speech recogniser will expect the
      leading zeros to be used in the command (i.e. car number 021 can
      be referred to as "zero twenty one", "oh twenty one", "zero two
      one" or "zero twenty one" in all cases, and "twenty one" or "two
      one" only if there's no other car in the session with number 21)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - Allow car numbers with leading zeros to be
      read by the full course yellow / formation lap code (e.g. car 009
      will now be read as "zero zero nine")<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reduce the maximum frequency of opponent tyre change
      messages to prevent spamming when many cars pit for different
      tyres at the same time<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix for some potential start up issues<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed toggle_mute button function not working
      properly<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - new plugin version and some additional DRS
      messages<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.8</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix for spotter being always set to 'ovals' mode
      on road courses (missing beeps, some other changes - sorry guys).
      Ovals mode will now only be enabled on ovals, as intended<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed nAudio beeps not responding to volume changes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added new button binding for 'Toggle mute' - mutes
      all app sounds and unmutes when pressed again<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Change spotter behaviour on ovals to prevent the
      spotter monopolising the radio channel (non-spotter messages
      aren't blocked all the time). This disables the radio beeps on
      ovals and starts spotting immediately on race start. Note this
      affects oval tracks only. You can revert to the old spotter
      behaviour by disabling the 'Enable enhanced spotter on ovals'
      property<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some button assignments not working until the
      app was restarted<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed broken pit stall count down<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some broken validation that was preventing gap
      ahead and gap behind messages playing in some circumstances<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed broken 'play corner names' command<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow voice commands that refer to opponent cars
      (e.g. "what's the car ahead's last lap time") to be assigned to
      buttons - you need to add opponentDataCommand: true to the
      buttonAssignment element in controllerConfigurationData.json in
      these cases<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Prevent fuel estimates playing too close together<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* fixed cases where the app switches to multi-class
      mode when it shouldn't - when there are too many unknown car
      classes in a session the app now reverts to single-class mode as
      intended<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AMS / RF1 - update race start positions shortly
      after the green light - should fix cases where the 'bad start'
      message was playing when it shouldn't<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix for iRacing crash bug<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow fuel consumption calculations to be based on
      the lap with the highest representative fuel usage - this should
      produce more accurate fuel calculations on ovals and in cases
      where there's just been a full-course-yellow / caution period or
      other event that can significantly reduce fuel consumption. By
      default the app will use max per-lap consumption on oval courses
      and a windowed average consumption on road courses. Enable 'Base
      fuel calculations on max fuel consumption' property to use max
      per-lap consumption on all tracks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play laptime or pace report for laps which are
      several seconds slower than your pace<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few assorted fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - added support for WebHud so Crew Chief can
      send data to WebHud in place of dash.exe. This should also be
      slightly more efficient that the old dash.exe program. Enable this
      with the 'Enable WebHud integration (R3E only)' property<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - additional messages for formation laps and
      full course yellows<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - reworked session position logic to reduce
      inaccurate position calls<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - added support for new shared memory layout
      introduced in latest game update<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - incorporated more stock car rules and added
      some additional car class mappings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - fixed some issues introduced in last RF2 game
      update<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some minor bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - map the 'pits are open' flag and added BMW
      M8 car data and a couple of Okayama layout corner mappings (still
      some missing recordings here)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - various tweaks including lone practice support
      and stock car improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - mapped Sepang and Nordschleife corners (VLN
      and Nords layouts only) - might not be very accurate (it's a big
      track and the available maps aren't great)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.7.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play lap time comparisons during full course
      yellow<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed button assignments being ignored when Voice
      Recognition Mode is set to 'Press and release button'<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.6.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Minor bug fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AC: ensure tracks always have 2 or 3 sectors - this
      *definitely* fixes long-standing issues with some longer add-on
      tracks that report 4 or more sectors<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.6.8</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some stability fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.6.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed nAudio speech recognition<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some more minor improvements to the controllers code<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.6.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Simplified macros file format (removed the per-game
      key mappings) and added a UI to allow macros to be created and
      edited from the app. Important: if you've created your own macros
      or have been helping us test our recent beta releases, please
      rename Documents/CrewChiefV4/saved_command_macros.json before
      starting the app. See Command Macros section of help.txt for more
      info<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Re-wrote controllers code to cope with badly behaved
      devices (device scans that take many minutes and devices that
      disconnect and reconnect during play). Controllers are no longer
      scanned at start-up (press Scan for Controllers to initiate a
      device scan)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Moved saved button assignments to
      Documents/CrewChiefV4/controllerConfigurationData.json. This has
      been extended to allow any of the existing basic voice commands to
      be mapped to a button - see Button Mappings section in help.txt
      for more info<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow cut track warnings to be enabled / disabled
      with a voice command ("enable cut track warning" / "no cut track
      warnings") or a button binding ("Toggle cut track warnings on /
      off")<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some simple camber and pressure responses using
      average inner-middle-outer tyre temps recorded during the previous
      lap (voice commands "how are my [front / rear] cambers" / "how's
      my [left front / right front / etc] camber", and "how are my tyre
      pressures" / "how are my [front / rear] tyre pressures"). You can
      also add "...right now" to this voice command to get the current
      inner-middle-out temps (not averaged). Note this isn't well
      tested, might give bad advice, and doesn't work with iRacing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AC - another attempt to fix weird crash on tracks
      with &gt; 3 sectors<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - updated plugin to include stock car rules
      logic and added more stock car (oval) specific messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - added more messages for various penalties and
      other conditions;<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.6.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Automatically scan for controllers on app start<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Better handling of controllers<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disable some irrelevant messages on in-laps<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - better (more detailed) penalty messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - updated plugin with more data and additional
      features not exposed via official rF2 Internals API. These are
      turned off by default - to enable them see 'rFactor2 Unofficial
      Features' section in README.txt<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.6.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Tweaked manual rolling start logic for multiclass
      races, so each class has its own pole-sitter for determining when
      to start the race (can be disabled with the 'Manual formation lap
      separate classes' option)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Significantly reduced the size of debug traces<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked console logging output to fix some
      potential crash bugs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - potential fix for incorrect race start
      position in multiclass races (this caused quite a few issues)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.6.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix for iRacing crash<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.6.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Extended free-text macros a little (upper case
      characters and slash)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* prevent off-track messages expiring immediately in
      practice sessions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* speech recognition fixes when running with 'disable
      alternate voice commands' switched on<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* automatically save console logs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fixed debug logging on ovals<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - some bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.6.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Corrected some car classes for AC and R3E<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - updated plugin<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - more accurate pit stall location detection<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Billy Strange spotter with latest sound pack
      update<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.5.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Notify when given slowdown penalty<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AC - fix crash when restarting app<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* a few minor fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.5.8</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some fuel calculation tweaks - near the start of the
      race, use the max per-lap consumption when calculating required
      fuel<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Save pitstop benchmark times for each car / track /
      game combination so they persist between runs of the app (written
      to /Documents/CrewChiefV4/pit_benchmarks.json) - this is enabled
      by default but can be disabled with the 'Save pitstop benchmark
      times to disk' property<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - workaround for missing spotter calls after
      driver swaps (thanks to kcr55 for this one)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - use tyre compound name rather than index when
      deriving tyre types - should fix issues where mods declare
      different available tyre compound sets<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCars2 - make macro key presses a bit longer so
      they're less likely to be missed by the game (note this makes the
      refuelling macro execute quite slowly)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.5.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed RF2 tyre type mapping and added Hyper-Soft
      tyre<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Use correct 'drizzling' sounds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added spotter 'Florian' (in latest sound pack
      update)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.5.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't allow some messages to be inserted into the
      space between spotter messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some work to prevent stale messages being played
      (e.g. after a delay caused by the spotter)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play fuel warnings when on a low-fuel run in
      qualifying or practice<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Prevent some position messages being played twice<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reduce repetition of some messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Ignore rear tyre and brake temperatures in FWD
      classes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More internal threading fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few other tweaks and fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.5.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Macro overhaul - more flexible system which should
      be easier to work with. Includes example chat macros and an 'add
      fuel, XXX litres' macro (where XXX is 0 - 150) (R3E and pCars2
      only). See the 'Advanced command macros' section of the help.txt
      file or
      http://thecrewchief.org/showthread.php?263-Command-key-press-macros&amp;p=2378&amp;viewfull=1#post2378




      for more info<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some shutdown delays that can happen when
      closing the app without pressing 'stop' first<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed radio channel sometimes being left open after
      a spotter call<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed brake and suspension damage not being reset
      after repairs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to play pit box distance messages in
      feet ('Pit box distance countdown in feet')<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to play a 5-4-3-2-1 style pit box count
      down ('Pit box time countdown' property, disabled by default).
      Reaches zero 30 metres from the pit stall by default (configurable
      with 'Pit box time countdown end point (metres)' property) - note
      that this may be inaccurate if the pit box is close to the start
      line due to the way lap distances work when in the pit lane,
      especially on tracks where the pitlane is significantly longer or
      shorter than the racing surface<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Make volume control sliders more fine grained to
      allow better control over volume<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF1 / AMS: revised cut track logic - should reduce
      cut track warnings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCars2 - 'request pit' macro now checks the pit
      request state from the game and responds accordingly<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCars2 - added "cancel pit request" macro<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Various bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.5.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Internal overhaul for better performance and
      stability. Fixes some threading / resource issues that could cause
      instability on shutdown, changes to how the internal event
      processing works to make it faster and less resource-hungry,
      removed 'disable immediate messages' option as this is no longer
      needed, reduced CPU overhead in lots of other places<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed app crash when failing to initialise nAudio
      background sounds player<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCars2 - added 'pCars 2 spotter car length'
      property, default 5 metres (app was using whatever had been set in
      the pCars1 version of this property)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.5.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix laps-to-go calculation - it's now based on the
      number of laps completed by the overall leader so should be
      correct when you've been lapped<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow for changing conditions when determining the
      player's pace and best lap time - comparisons are only made to
      laps completed in broadly similar conditions and best lap set in
      the current conditions is used when working out things like
      expected laps remaining and required fuel loads<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed rounding errors in fuel calculations that
      could accumulate to substantial amounts<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Use overall fuel consumption when determining how
      much fuel to add, rather than recent fuel consumption (the app
      sometimes under-fuelled if the player was fuel saving in the laps
      before his pit stop)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - fixed some missing state transitions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCars2 - use updated RainDensity data for more
      fine-grained rain calls<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some performance improvements<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.5.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added support for F1 2018 *spotter only*. This uses
      the UDP data stream sent by the game - the app listens on the
      default port 20777 (can be changed with the 'F1 2018 UDP Port'
      property). This is an early implementation so expect some bugs -
      please report them. Again, it's only the spotter - the app doesn't
      interpret any of the other game data so it won't give other calls
      or be able to answer any questions. I may add full support later,
      but as the crew chief built into the game is actually pretty good
      this isn't a high priority<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - updated plugin to latest version<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.5.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some fuel calculation fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added fuel-window messge in races which have no
      mandatory stop but will need a single fuel stop<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some internal fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reduced likelihood of yellow flag warnings for cars
      that have already quit to pits<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fixed issues with opening lap data<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.4.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added alarm clock function - say 'set alarm at
      twenty oh five', for example or preset it in properties "Alarm
      time(s). "Enable alarm clock voice commands" must be enabled
      before the alarm clock voice commands works<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Alternate sound pack internal rework<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Mark abandoned laps as invalid<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More ghost detection improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - removed 'confirm penalty' macro as this is no
      longer needed and can cause issues<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked fuel-to-end reserve calculation - you can
      now specify a number of laps worth of additional fuel to add as a
      reserve when fuelling to the end of the race. The 'Additional fuel
      to add to finish the race (number of laps worth)' property can be
      a whole or fractional number of laps<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Various bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.4.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Enable some of the multiclass warnings in qualifying
      and practice sessions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow the wait timeout for Trigger Word speech
      recognition mode to be set ('Trigger word wait timeout', default 5
      seconds). The app will wait this many milliseconds for a command
      after hearing the trigger word before giving up<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some broken personalisations from the last
      update (a few of the personalised messages weren't loading)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - better 'oval' detection (should prevent
      the app using oval spotter sounds on some road courses)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - allow 'add fuel' voice commands without a
      unit (e.g. "pitstop add 12") - will use whatever fuel unit the app
      is configured to read fuel amounts in<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.4.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added 'Trigger word' voice recognition mode. With
      this enabled voice recognition works a bit like 'OK Google' or
      Alexa - the app listens for a special keyword or phrase
      (configurable in the 'Speech recogniser trigger word' property,
      default value 'Chief'). When it hears the keyword it starts
      listening for a regular voice command for a few seconds. This
      doesn't work with nAudio input<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some corner name mapping fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Changed default interrupting behaviour so only
      spotter messages interrupt the Chief<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Only consider rear wheels as locked if both are
      locked at the same time in common FWD cars like WTCC and WTCR
      (prevents the app warning about locking the unloaded inside rear
      on turn-in)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* When requesting fuel estimates for a given time or
      lap count, the app now reads back the time / lap count you
      requested along with the fuel estimate (e.g. "for 25 minutes, we
      estimate you'll need about 30 litres")<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E: reworked hotlap single practice mode detection
      - should prevent spotter playing in these game modes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Various internal fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.4.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed a few cases where messages play when they
      shouldn't<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reduce repetition of blue flag messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 - fix 1970s F1 class mappings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - use average temp round track now this has
      been updated in the SDK to be dynamic<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.4.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Prevent unimportant messages playing if the player
      is fighting with other cars in a race session or is on a flying
      lap in a qualifying session (disabled by default, enable this with
      the 'Advanced message prioritisation' option)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow app update check to be skipped - adding the
      start argument SKIP_UPDATES to your shortcut will prevent the app
      checking for updates (but it'll still check for sound pack
      updates)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Report yellow flag messages even if we're in a
      corner / braking zone<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Various bug fixes and tweaks<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.4.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed regression in non-English speech recognition
      config files - the 'defaultLocale' property name for speech
      recognition language had been changed to 'language', so the app
      was ignoring this value in existing configurations. The app will
      now use the 'defaultLocale' property value if it doesn't find a
      'language' property<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.3.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow spotter messages to play if they have
      interrupted another message, even if they would otherwise have
      expired<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - enable fuel tracking in lone practice
      sessions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - Added option to re fuel to end of race in
      a race session when entering the pitlane, this will not trigger if
      you get a tow back to pits it only works for regular preformed
      pitstop!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - some multiclass fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCars2 - performance improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* internal rework - consolidated lots of timings code
      to make behaviour more consistent across games<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Speech recognition engine initialisation
      improvements - better handling of language / country options,
      better management of installed components and error reporting<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Improvements to interrupting logic<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Various bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.3.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to pause most messages in braking and
      cornering zones (sections of the track starting from heavy braking
      and ending with near-full throttle application) - this doesn't
      apply to spotter messages or other very high priority messages. It
      can be enabled and disabled with a button mapping ('Toggle delay
      messages on hard parts') or a voice command ('don't talk in the
      [corners/braking zones]' / 'no messages in the [corners/braking
      zones]', 'talk to me anywhere' / 'messages at any point'). This
      feature is switched off by default - the initial state is set with
      the 'Delay messages on hard parts' option. Note that you need to
      drive at least one valid lap before the app can work out which
      sections of the track it needs to keep quiet in. This feature is
      disabled for ovals and may produce odd results on very short
      tracks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added some basic message prioritisation - higher
      priority messages will be inserted into the queue in front of
      lower priority messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Replaced the 'Spotter and responses block other
      messages' property. The spotter (and some 'critical' messages) now
      interrupt and block regular messages (most things except voice
      command responses and some other important messages) by default.
      Enable the 'Command responses and important messages block other
      messages' to allow other types of important message (such as voice
      command responses and yellow flags) to also interrupt and block
      messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Prevent any further fragments of a message from
      playing if this message was interrupted<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Simplified pitstop benchmark process - you can now
      get a benchmark pitstop time without having to set a hot lap first
      (although you'll still need to set one after your stop to allow
      the app to work out the time loss)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.3.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reduce size of 'personalisations' update pack
      install this update before updating your personalisations<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Much more accurate tyre life prediction using a
      non-linear curve fit of tyre wear data recorded for the current
      tyre set (assumes a tyre is worn out when it has 5% life left)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added more info to the fuel status message - now
      includes fuel-to-end<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow spotter sounds to cancel other queued messages
      (disabled by default, enable with 'Spotter and responses block
      other messages' property - note this can sound strange when only
      the start or end sounds of a message play)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few minor tweaks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fix white-flag message spam<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.3.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed sound pack version check<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.3.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Changed how sound pack downloads are handled -
      should significantly reduce the size of sound pack updates<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added property categories to make finding stuff
      easier<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added opponent pit exit prediction warning - if the
      app thinks an opponent car will probably come out of the pits
      close to you (and it can read his driver name), you'll be warned
      about him<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Further opponent pit exit estimation improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* some internal bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.3.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed opponent time in pitlane when timing opponent
      stops for pit strategy calls<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Take mandatory pitstop status into account when
      deriving expected post-pit opponent positions (assume opponents
      who still haven't pitted will pit this lap if we're at the end of
      the pit window)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added and corrected a few car classes (pCars2,
      iRacing and R3E)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fixed some car class allocation issues<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.3.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Improved pit stop exit prediction when opponents are
      in the pitlane<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't reset the fuel data when leaving the pits
      during a race, unless we've added fuel<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.3.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix for pitstop prediction additions (see
      previous release notes). This fixes the wildly inaccurate pit stop
      time loss estimates reported by the pitstop benchmark process if
      you make the benchmark request too late in the lap (after you've
      entered the final sector)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.3.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* First cut of pit exit prediction - obtain a
      benchmark pit time in practice by making the 'time this stop' /
      'practice pitstop' / 'time this pitstop' / 'pitstop benchmark'
      command, or by pressing the "Pitstop prediction" button before
      make your practice stop. The pit exit prediction will play
      automatically some time after requsting a stop, or if you make the
      'Where will be be after a stop?' / 'Estimate pit exit positions' /
      'What will happen if I pit?' command, or by pressing the "Pitstop
      prediction" button during a race (see 'Pit exit position
      prediction' section in the readme.txt)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disable cold brakes warnings for some car classes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - detect if this and next laps are invalidated
      due to cut track in quali/practice<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - disable pit stall position messages in post
      race<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - improve cut track detection<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - fix best lap time not announced during
      leaderboard challenge<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AC - fix crashes due to unexpected timings reported
      by the game<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Suppress crashes when using Naudio Input - (but
      please send us log file if you get exceptions in log)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix issue where best lap time is lost if it is set
      after an invalid lap<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix incorrect gaps announced if vehicles aren't
      within the same lap<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix DRS messages announced incorrectly if opponent
      is pitting<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Make 'half fuel' call play at exactly half fuel (was
      playing a bit too early)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* App wide bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.2.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow pit countdown past session finish (for
      cooldown lap)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't grumble about a stopped engine if the car is
      still moving<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some additional checks to handle delayed opponent
      position data<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - improve live position tracking<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - improve retired vehicle detection<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - race finish position improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - finishing position detection improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - reliability fixes)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* rF2 - suppress pit messages while in garage/monitor<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AC - fixed crash bug on 2-sector tracks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E &amp; pCars2 - use game-provided time gaps to
      car in front / behind (more accurate than derived gaps)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - DRS message accuracy improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - removed auto-confirm pit macro and associated
      logic (no longer needed, and can cause some issues with pitstops)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E - disable spotter in hotlap mode<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.2.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added commands to check self pace, you can ask
      "how's my self gap" / "how's my personal pace" / "how's my delta
      best" to see how you're doing relative to your own best lap<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fixed pit stall countdown<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - fix finish position reporting<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing - allow pit voice commands to be enabled or
      disabled ("Enable iRacing pit stop commands", default enabled).
      Disabling them removes them from the phrases the speech
      recognition engine listens for, potentially improving accuracy for
      other phrases as well as preventing false positives<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added ability to specify if car class has speed
      limiter via "limiterAvailable" class field<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* rF2 - enable pit stall countdown (doesn't work on
      some tracks, disabled on ovals)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* rF2 - Add option to force Rolling Start start type<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.2.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed incorrect car class data in R3E online
      practice and qualifying sessions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Logging readability improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Small AMS performance improvement<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.2.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix for Assetto Corsa broken spotter<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.2.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AMS off-track warning tweak - make 'kerb' a legal
      surface to drive on (should make the warnings much less common)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few other AMS fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Half distance fuel calculation tweak to make it a
      little more conservative<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing workarounds for missing opponent data when
      cars aren't rendered by the game<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few other iRacing bug fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some UI tweaks to fix tab ordering and add shortcut
      keys (underlined on the UI)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.2.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed missing fuel data in RF2<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to specify how much 'reserve' to add
      when doing fuel calculations (enable the "Enable tight fuel
      calculations" property and set the reserve amount with the
      "Additional fuel to finish the race" property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed iRacing SoF calculation<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Various minor tweaks<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.2.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* IMPORTANT FOR IRACING USERS: This release includes
      changes to address recent stability issues. Unfortunately we've
      not had enough feedback to be sure these have worked. By default
      the app will continue to use a component that had been causing
      crashes - we've modified this component to fix the crashes but it
      still needs more testing. If the app crashes (disappears with an
      error message popup, taking focus away from the game) then please
      tell us. If you experience crashes go to the Properties screen and
      disable the 'iRacing faster parser' property<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* New RF2 shared memory plugin with better performance<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reinstated an iRacing crash fix that got lost in a
      previous update<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.1.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added tyre temperature thresholds for some missing
      tyre types (including wets) - should fix incorrect temperature
      warnings on wets and some other tyres<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Mapped player tyre type in pCars 2 (note this
      doesn't support mixed tyre types)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed an issue with iRacing driver swaps that caused
      log-spam and performance issues<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.1.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing hotfix for crash in mapper<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.1.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More detailed error messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCars and pCars2 performance improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing performance improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* AC fixes for shorter tracks (2 sectors)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed inaccurate race position messages in iRacing
      'checkered flag' phase<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some iRacing stability improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Use relative lap time difference when working out
      when to give multi-class warnings. This uses 2 new Properties -
      'Multi-class slower car warning time' and 'Multi-class faster car
      warning time' - this is the approximate average amount of notice
      you want the app to give you when approaching a different class
      car<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added iRacing voice commands to get out of car ('get
      out') and get the average SoF ('what's the sof' / 'what is the
      strength of field')<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* For Assetto Corsa, only allow multi-class races if
      the number of unknown car models does not exceed property 'Max
      unknown car models in ACS multi-class races' (default 0) - this is
      necessary because Assetto doesn't expose proper class data. This
      prevents the app dividing participants into different classes
      unless the app recognises all the car models in the session<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.1.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Workaround for iRacing opponent pitting message spam<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.1.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Minor multi-class tweaks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Assume single class if most car classes in a race
      are unknown to the app (AC, rF2 and rF1 only)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added button to save console output to a file (in
      Documents/ CrewChiefV4/debug/)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some AC internal fixes for inaccurate lap count data<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't give damage and tyre wear responses in iRacing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Lee spotter and updated Geoffrey spotter to
      add missing oval sounds (in latest sound pack update)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.1.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Major internal overhaul to fully support multiclass
      races - opponents and positions are now tracked correctly for the
      player's car class, the app doesn't make calls about opponent
      laptimes, pitting, and other stuff if they're not in the same
      class as the player<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added multi-class specific messages for when you're
      lapping or being lapped by other classes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added multi-class specific voice commands "is the
      car ahead in my class", "is the car behind my class", "what class
      is the car ahead", "what class is the car behind" and variations<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More performance improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Speculative fixes for driver swaps in iRacing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed 'enable driver names' flag being ignored for
      some messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added optional pit box countdown (R3E and iRacing
      only, disabled by default - enable with property
      "pit_box_position_countdown")<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* rF2 improvements: improved rolling start detection
      and distance to safety car detection, in SCR mode Crew Chief now
      respects DoubleFileType value and will announce last FCY lap
      Frozen Order instructions correctly<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to change left/right side tyres(iRacing
      only)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Modified R3E pit macros to take advantage of modify
      pit menu behaviour (should make the pit macros, particularly the
      auto-confirm pit actions, more reliable)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Retrieve gap ahead / gap behind as late as possible
      when playing gap messages to improve accuracy<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Made auto-refuel ("fuel to the end" macro in R3E and
      "pitstop fuel to the end" command in iRacing) a bit more
      conservative - more so at longer tracks<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.0.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added messages for oil and fuel pressure warnings
      (iRacing only)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added messages for stalling the engine<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added messages when you crash very heavily - the app
      will ask if you're OK and, if you're using voice commands, wait
      for you to respond (these can be disabled with the "Enable crash
      messages" option in Properties)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Only use start-line track temperature in pCARS to
      prevent the app calling local track temp variations<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow multi-class support to be disabled ("Force
      single class" property) - useful if you're playing with 3rd party
      content that has incorrect car class IDs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More performance improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Prevent the app's windows being resized such that
      controls are no longer visible (this behaviour can be disabled by
      unchecking the "Force minimum window size" property)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.0.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play 'good pass' message in pCARS 2 if we've
      just collided with someone (might still need some tuning)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some minor performance improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed issues with historical weather data being lost<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCARS 2 pit window fixes (again...)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed missing DQ / DNF session end messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed mid-point fuel report saying "fuel looks good"
      when it clearly isn't good<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.0.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed 'box this lap' messages playing in pCARS2 even
      though the player had completed his mandatory stop<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some pCARS2 off track warning tweaks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked R3E opponent lap invalidation code - should
      prevent the app incorrectly invalidating opponent laps<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Speculative fix for session end being 1 lap too late
      for iRacing fixed number of lap races<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.0.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added voice command to get and estimate of how much
      fuel is needed to finish the race - "how much fuel to the end" /
      "how much fuel do we need"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added voice command to get an estimate of how long
      the tyres will last (in minutes for timed sessions, laps for fixed
      lap number sessions) - "how long will the tires last" / "how long
      on these tires" / "how long will these tires last"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added check to prevent a stopped car triggering
      incident warnings repeatedly<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added ability to set pit fuel amount in iRacing -
      "pitstop fuel to the end" / "pitstop fuel to the end of the race"
      - and via a macro in R3E and pCARS2 - "fuel to the end" / "fuel to
      the end of the race". See the 'Advanced command macros' section of
      the help.txt file or this {detailed forum post} for more info
      (please read the documentation before using this in R3E or pCARS2
      as it requires the default in-game pit strategy to be configured
      in a particular way, and is quite fragile - use at your own risk).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Immediately close the pit menu in R3E after running
      a macro if we're close to the pit entry (if the menu is left open
      when you cross the limiter line, the auto-confirm macro will fail)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* If sound pack downloads fail, retry with the other
      server - should fix issue that prevented some users downloading
      sound updates<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.0.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't make Assetto Corsa spotter calls when viewing
      replays<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Derive opponent laptimes and sector 3 times in
      Raceroom instead of using data provided by the game as the data
      provided by the game are always 1 lap out of date<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked some of the sector gap logic<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reduce frequency of repeated "the next car is..."
      messages<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.0.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some issues in pCARS 2 session end detection
      and pre-start message triggering<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disable pcars2 spotter in pits<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some minor performance improvements<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.0.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Hotfix to prevent some stock car rules messages
      triggering when they shouldn't<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't read lap times or gaps if we're under full
      course yellow<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added possible track cut warning for pCars2<br>
      <h4>Version 4.9.0.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added support for rF2 StockCarRules plugin, CC will
      now announce Lucky Dog, Wave Around, EOLL messages. To enable make
      sure you enable the "Use American terms" option, disable
      StockCarRules plugin in rF2, and set "EnableStockCarRulesPlugin":1
      for "rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll" - see this {detailed
      forum post} for more information<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Add option to disable pit state announcement during
      FCY in rF2 and rF1/AMS<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disable brake temp messages on ovals<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed pit macros not working for some R3E players<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Prevent some messages playing when they're not
      appropriate or no longer relevant<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some internal fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.3.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed AC plugin after game update - the app should
      ask if you want to update the plugin when you first launch it in
      AC mode<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More fixes to the manual rolling start logic<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing session transition crash fix<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some car class tweaks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added nAudio speech recognition code to allow voice
      recognition input device selection (enable with property "Use
      nAudio for speech recognition" - thanks to Daniel Nowak for this
      one)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disable sector delta messages on ovals and use more
      generous spotter parameters<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.3.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Corrected some pCARS 2 track names that got changed
      in the last pCARS 2 patch<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disable some irrelvant sounds when racing on ovals<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Work around for some missing spotter sounds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few internal fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.3.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Changed personalisations download process to reduce
      bandwidth use<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.2.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed a serious regression in multi-class race
      position tracking (sorry for the double release guys...)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.2.8</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added more variety to race finish messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Make default R3E pit macro pause a while before
      closing menu<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Warn when an opponent car is exiting the pits<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few other minor bits and bobs<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.2.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Experimental support for double-file manual rolling
      starts (R3E, pCARS2 &amp; AC only - enable with "Manual formation
      lap double-file start" property)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed arrow keys and some other keys not being
      released when used in command macros<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing rally cross fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More Formula E battery tracking logic and messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Split some longer voice command responses so if you
      want to hear more, you have to ask ("more information" / "more
      info" / "clarify") - currently only implemented for Formula E
      battery messages, but will be extended. If you want all the
      information in a single long response without having to ask for
      clarification, enable "Verbose messages" property<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added missing RF1 / AMS blue flag override ("Enable
      AMS / rF1 blue on slower" property<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some internal fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.2.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some nAudio bugs that meant the radio beeps
      were being sent to the wrong audio device<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Hong Kong track mappings (RF2 Formula E pack)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added voice command to get player incident count
      ("how many incidents do I have" / "what's my incident count") and
      session incident limit ("what's the incident limit") - iRacing
      only<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added voice command to get player licence ("what's
      my licence class") and iRating ("whats my iRating") - iRacing only<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added voice command to get opponent licence ("what's
      [the guy in front's / the leader's / p10's / Bob's] licence
      class") and iRating ("what's [the guy in front's / the leader's /
      p10's / Bob's] iRating") - iRacing only<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed tyre temperature thresholds on some R3E car
      classes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Battery monitoring bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.2.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked battery status message (response to voice
      command/button command), added battery use increase/decrease
      detection<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added pit stop related messages for pCARS2<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some internal bug fixing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow spotter sounds ("car left" etc) to have their
      volume scaled relative to the other voice messages (property
      "spotter_volume_boost")<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.2.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added battery related logic for electric cars (RF2
      Formula E)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.2.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some performance issues when using nAudio
      playback<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some internal sound player rework and bug fixing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added "TTS volume boost" - by default the TTS sounds
      are now played at 2x volume, which balances them better with the
      the other sounds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added TTS trim start and trim end properties to
      remove silence from TTS sounds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added "Only use TTS when there is no alternative"
      option. When set to 'true' (the default) the app will drop
      messages or use generic terms to refer to opponents when it
      doesn't have a driver name recording. It will use TTS for driver
      names only if the message is considered essential (when e.g.
      responding to "who's in front?" voice command). The recommended
      TTS configuration is now to enable TTS, set "Only use TTS when
      there is no alternative" to true, set "TTS volume boost" to 2,
      "Trim end of TTS sounds" to 600 and "Trim start of TTS sounds" to
      100 - see 'Help and getting started' for more information<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow iracing tyre pressure adjustment voice
      commands to be made in PSI (when property "iRacing tyre pressure
      adjustments in PSI" is true the app assumes you mean PSI)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed broken voice recognition for "who's ahead",
      "who's behind" and "who's leading" commands<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Ross spotter to latest sound pack<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow iRacing fuel to be added in gallons<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.2.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Work-around for R3E missing sector number updates
      when cars exit to pits (should fix a lot of inaccurate calls in
      practice and qualifying)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed mute not working properly in nAudio mode<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Simplified track landmark generation (see Help)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some internal bugfixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.1.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Improvements to speech recogntion accuracy<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Integrated nAudio library for sound playback which
      allows you to choose play back devices for messages and background
      sounds (disabled by default - enable this with the "Use nAudio for
      playback" option) - this also allows the app to play back at
      higher volumes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added lots of iRacing pit commands (see the voice
      commands section in Help)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Lots of iRacing bug fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added a new spotter (Micha - in the latest sound
      pack)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.1.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Opponent to player delta bug fixes (all games)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added macros for some iRacing black-box interactions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added new Pace Notes feature for recording and
      playing back user-created pace notes (see Help)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed arrow keys not working for macros<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed a few minor lap time reporting issues<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Lots of iRacing fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.1.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Better UI handling of sound pack downloads (app
      should no longer appear to hang while unpacking sounds)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Announce retired and DQ'ed drivers in RF2<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed stale driverID in iRacing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Minor bug fixes - Mark out laps as invalid in R3E
      (should prevent stale lap time calls at the end of an out lap),
      RF2 pre-lights and overtake messages and track landmark mapping
      getting lost on session restart, pCARS 2 pit exit messages<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.1.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Better pruning of pCARS2 stale and duplicated
      opponent data in online sessions (hacks adapted from pCARS1 to
      work around bugs inherited from pCARS1)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added opponent retired and opponent disqualified
      messages (pCARS2 / R3E) - will be enabled with next sound pack
      update<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E and pCARS2 car and track mapping fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.1.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed an issue in the speech recogniser where
      grammars were initialised multiple times, reducing recognition
      accuracy - this should make the recogniser work more reliably<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed an issue in R3E and AC where a invalidated in
      sector 3 could cause stale best-lap data to be announced<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Remove opponents who are reported as DNF / DQ / DNS
      in R3E<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added experimental option 'Disable alternative voice
      commands' (disabled by default). Enabling this will force the
      speech recogniser to only load the first command from each row in
      speech_recognition_config.txt. Instead of recognising any of
      "who's leading", "who's in the lead", "who is leading", "who is in
      the lead", or "who's the leader" the app will only recognise the
      first in the list - "who's leading". This will limit the number of
      phrases the recogniser understands and *may* improve recognition
      accuracy<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.1.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More iRacing bug fixes, mostly around session state
      tracking<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Improved default pCARS2 command macros (massive
      thanks to Belaki on the pCARS forums)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed pCARS2 pit window end message playing when it
      shouldn't<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 bug fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added overall damage report - triggered by voice
      command ("damage report / how's my car / is my car ok") or button
      assignment<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added session status report (race time remaining,
      pit status, gaps etc) - triggered by voice command ("session
      status / race status") or button assignment<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added car status report (damage, fuel, tyres etc) -
      triggered by voice command ("car status") or button assignment<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added combined status status report (session status
      + car status report) - triggered by voice command ("full update /
      full status / update me") or button assignment<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added a few more messages<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.1.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Corrected and added some corner mappings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added function to read corner mappings for the
      current lap (activated with a button assignment or voice command
      "read corner names" / "corner names" / "tell me the corner names")<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More iRacing beta updates<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Tweaked overtake message probability<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.1.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* iRacing beta<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* pCARS2 beta (shared memory only - UDP isn't ready)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Pit command macros beta (example implementations for
      R3E and pCARS2 included - see the "Command macros" section at the
      end of the Help file, and saved_command_macros.json in the app's
      installation folder)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed lap time issues in AC (caused by the laptime
      not being sent to the app at the same time as the new-lap
      notification)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Extended support for RF2 StockCar rules plugin<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More car class and track mapping data<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 opponent pit detection and additional pit
      messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Mute the background sound when you talk to the chief<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Block all messages when you're talking to the chief
      (optional - use property "Block messages when talking to the
      Chief")<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Small improvements and bugfixes for RF2, PCars, AC
      and R3E<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Attempt to predict when it might rain for pCARS and
      pCARS2 (shared memory only, enabled by default - use property
      "Enable PCars rain prediction using CloudBrightness" to disable).
      Note this uses changes in reported CloudBrightness value and is
      quite inaccurate<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.0.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 fixes - fixed low fuel message playing when it
      shouldn't, fixed European versions of full course yellow messages
      not playing on new installs<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.0.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 DRS support<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF1 / AMS and RF2 cut track warnings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 full-course-yellow, standing start and rolling
      start order messages (pace line, grid box, left / right column)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E opponent laptime validation fix - should prevent
      the app playing some incorrect opponent laptimes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play aero damage if the rest of the car is
      knackered<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed first lap out of pits massively skewing fuel
      consumption estimate<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some other random fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.0.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed broken PCars2 oval track mapping - should now
      correctly call 'car low' / 'car high' on ovals for all spotters
      except Geoffrey<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.0.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added some Project Cars 2 stuff - game type, launch
      options, and a couple of initial track mappings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some incorrect tyre temperature warnings<br>
      <h4>Version 4.8.0.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Updated Assetto Corsa plugin to be compatible with
      latest AC update<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added "Block messages when talking to the chief"
      option - this prevents any messages being played while you're
      making a voice command<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some fuel consumption calculation fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.9.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E 64Bit support<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added voice command to tell you (once the data is
      availalbe) what the relative performance difference is between
      different tyre types based on the best lap in the session for tyre
      type - e.g. "Softs are about 0.4 seconds faster than Mediums,
      Mediums are about 1.2 seconds faster than Hards". The voice
      command is "Give me tyre pace differences", "What are the tire
      speeds?" / "Whats the difference between tires?" / "Compare tire
      compounds" (R3E and RF2 only)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added opponent tyre type info when they leave the
      pits after changing tyre type (R3E and RF2 only)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.9.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More RF2 race end detection fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Imola corner mappings for R3E<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* fixed race start message being repeated on manual
      rolling starts<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some additional checks to prevent mandatory pitstop
      messages playing during or after you've completed your stop<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.9.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Compatibility fixes for new Raceroom shared memory
      layout<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Map to new Raceroom tyre types - you can ask "what
      tyres is [opponent name] on?", or "what tyres am I on?"<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.9.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Better sound pack update mechanism - wastes less
      bandwidth<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added "minimise to tray" and "start minimised"
      options. Minimise to tray places a Crew Chief icon in the
      system-tray when you minimise the app, with a right-click menu
      contain commonly used functions. The app can be started minimised
      if desired<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added a new fuel calculation command ("calculate
      fuel for [x] [laps / minutes / hours]" / "how much fuel do i need
      for [x] [laps / minutes / hours]" / "how much fuel for [x] [laps /
      minutes / hours]") - for example, "how much fuel do I need for
      twenty minutes?". Assuming the app's had the chance to record your
      fuel usage over at least one lap (the more the better), it'll
      estimate how much fuel you'll need for the requested number of
      laps / time based on your average consumption. IMPORTANT: if you
      use this to set your fuel load in a timed race you MUST add extra
      fuel to account for the lap you need to finish after the race
      timer reaches zero. The app WILL NOT DO THIS FOR YOU - if you put
      in exactly 20 minutes worth of fuel for a 20 minute race you'll
      run out on the last lap<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Only allow manual formation lap mode to supress
      messages in race sessions (fixes missing messages in practice and
      qual with manual formation lap mode enabled)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed session end detection in RF2 / AMS / RF1 - the
      app should also detect when you click 'next session' without
      clicking 'end session' first<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some issues in the fuel use tracking logic<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.9.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed initialisation errors in TTS engine which
      prevented the app from starting when "Use TTS for missing names"
      was enabled<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* added option to select where the race starts on a
      manual formation lap - "Manual formation 'go' when leader crosses
      line". If this is true (the default) the app assumes that the race
      starts and cars are allowed to overtake as soon as the leader
      crosses the start line. If it's false, the app assumes that no one
      is allowed to overtake until they cross the start line<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added some RF1 session identifier fixes - should
      correct a few issues caused by the app thinking the race was
      actually qualifying.<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.8.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix for some settings getting corrupted on system
      which use a comma as a decimal separator - this causes some
      spotter and voice recognition issues. If you have already
      encountered this, please reload the app's default settings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added manual formation lap support. This supresses
      most messages on lap 1 and plays an alternate sequence of start
      messages - it assumes you're not allow to pass until you cross the
      start line. This mode can be activated and deactivated with a
      button press ("Toggle manual formation lap mode") or a voice
      command (enable with "this is the formation lap" / "formation lap"
      / "rolling start", disable with "standing start" / "no formation
      lap").<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some fuel use calculation fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Spotter fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.8.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added optional radio beeps for when the spotter or
      the Chief interrupt each other. "Insert beep-out between Spotter
      and Chief" plays the close-channel beep after the chief / spotter
      has finished, and "Insert beep-in between Spotter and Chief" (the
      default) plays the open-channel beep before the chief / spotter
      interrupts. The spotter and chief use different beep sounds here,
      and these options can be combined if you want 2 beeps (close then
      open) when interrupting<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Attempt to delete corrupted settings and force the
      app to restart if they can't be processed<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play fuel consumption estimate if it's 0
      litres per lap<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.8.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 plugin fixes for car damage issues in online
      races<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.8.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed spotter logic where it would consider 2 cars
      along side to be "3 side", even if those cars were one behind the
      other<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Use oval spotter messages (inside / outside) when on
      known oval tracks, if the selected spotter has these sounds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Tweaked spotter enable / disable sound to be a bit
      more appropriate for non-default spotter voice packs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed broken sector 3 time deltas in Project Cars<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.7.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed Assetto Corsa pit window open calculation for
      sessions with a fixed number of laps<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed a crash bug when starting the app with no
      sound pack<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.7.8</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added dropdown to main screen to allow a different
      spotter voice to be selected<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Geoffrey Lessel's awesome spotter sounds -
      these are in the latest sound pack. Select "Geoffrey" from the new
      'Spotter voice pack' menu<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed a couple more spotter bugs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added button binding to get fuel status (consumption
      and fuel remaining). The "how's my fuel?" voice command now
      reports the consumption as well as the remaining fuel<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.7.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More Scoops-Brand RF2 corner mappings<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some spotter bugs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added searching to Properties screen to make it a
      little less user-hostile<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Replaced the nasty underscore_property_names with
      proper names on the Properties screen<br>
      <h4>Version 4.7.7.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Substantial RF2 plugin rewrite<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Attempt to map game data if we detect the PCars2 exe
      - this does (apparently) work but expect some bugs and issues<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Ported some fixes from the PCars Android app - some
      free practice session improvements, more aggressive pruning of
      broken driver data, better (hopefully...) method of identifying
      player's data so monitoring other drivers shouldn't confuse the
      app<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.7.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Overhauled internal sound handling to make the app
      behave better<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Use game-provided mandatory pitstop data where
      available (should fix app thinking you've completed your mandatory
      pitstop when the game thinks otherwise)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some more car and track mappings from Scoops<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added 'three wide you're on the left' and 'three
      wide you're on the right' to the spotter - optional, disabled by
      default (spotter_enable_three_wide_left_and_right in the
      Properties screen)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added voice command to get info about the car in
      front / behind is slower / faster than you - "where should I
      attack" / "where am I faster" / "where can I attack" or "where
      should I defend" / "where am I slower" / "where is he faster" /
      "where will he attack"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Mapped Watkins Glen for PCars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few bug fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added fuel use per lap response - "what's my fuel
      usage" / "what's my fuel consumption" / "what's my fuel use"<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.6.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Faster start up times<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Better CPU usage<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some internal fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* more of Scoop's corner mappings (recordings still to
      be done)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.6.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some RFactor and RFactor2 issues<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added a few more track location mappings (thanks
      again Scoops)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disabled 'incident ahead' in R3E while I resolve the
      false-positives<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.6.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added a big set of corner name and location data
      thanks to Scoops' hard work<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Overhauled yellow flag logic for sector yellows and
      local yellows<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Read times accurate to hundredths of a second in
      some circumstances<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added oval-specific behaviours (enabled per-track
      with a flag in trackLandmarks.json) - ignores brake and left side
      tyre temps, estimates tyre wear from right side tyres only<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added an experimental 'realistic mode' option -
      enabling this supresses some messages based on car class and track
      (e.g. spotter is off at start of session when not on ovals, older
      car classes have less telemetry based info like tyre temps) - this
      is very much 'work in progress' &nbsp;&nbsp;* added per-car class
      behaviours for yellow flag phrasing (e.g. pace car vs safety car)
      and last lap message (e.g. "white flag" for last lap only applies
      to Indy and NASCAR cars)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added 'force update check' button<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.5.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed AC plugin after 1.14 update<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.5.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed a silly bug in the legacy R3E blue flag
      detection (used when flag rules are disabled)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.5.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Automatically switch between yellow and blue flag
      implementations in R3E depending on whether flag rules are enabled
      in-game<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added some more incident calling and yellow flag
      options<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added button mapping and voice command to suspend
      and enable yellow flag messages - enable with "give me yellows",
      "tell me yellows", "give me incident updates" or "give me yellow
      flag updates". Disable with "no more yellows", "stop incident
      updates", "don't give me yellows" or "don't tell me yellows"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed the "where is Bob?" voice message response in
      qual and practice sessions<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.4.9</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added R3E Mantorp Park (long), Norisring and
      Sachsenring corner data<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A bit more R3E flag tweaking<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.4.8</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Skip 'dead' opponent data copies coming from PCars
      (should fix a few issues with inaccurate opponent data)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added R3E Hungaroring corner data<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Made opponent incident detection less sensitive and
      added an option to disable it (enable_simple_incident_detection)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked opponent lap and sector handling to fix
      incorrect sector time and pace reports (all games)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Tweaked R3E yellow flag reporting to allow status
      changes to settle before reporting<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.4.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few minor bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.4.6</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some more Raceroom flag calling tweaks - should be
      less noisy but may miss rapidly changing flag situations<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added RF2 'stock car' mode (sound recordings to
      follow)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added R3E Nurburgring GP corner data<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.4.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some Raceroom flag calling tweaks<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.4.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Initial support for Raceroom yellow flag
      implementation and revised shared memory layout<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few minor bugs fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.4.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Delay lead change messages slightly and validate
      before playing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed error when working out where a pileup has
      occurred<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.4.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fix crash bug in PCars with UDP data<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.4.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added installer for game specific plugins (AC, AMS /
      RF1 and RF2) - the app now offers to copy the required plugin
      files to the games' install directory if they're missing or out of
      date<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* extended incident reporting logic and sounds to
      allow for multiple involved drivers to be reported (if we have the
      driver name sounds) or 'pileup' warning if 4 or more drivers are
      stopped in the same corner<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* added more corner names<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* opponent tracking fixes for PCars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* loads and loads of bugfixes and improvements<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.3.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Temporary hack to reduce wheel locking sensitivity -
      hopefully will prevent false-positives while I work out a better
      algorithm<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.3.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Temporary hack to reduce wheel spin sensitivity -
      hopefully will prevent false-positives while I work out a better
      algorithm<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* fixed Assetto Corsa pit window calls being 1 lap out<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.3.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* New Python module for Assetto Corsa - please replace
      your existing
      ...\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\apps\python\CrewChiefEx\
      folder with the new one in the app's install folder<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* New plugin for RF2 - please replace your existing
      ...\Steam\steamapps\common\rFactor2\Bin64\Plugins\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll




      with the new one in the app's install folder<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added corner names to some calls on several tracks
      (this is will a work-in-progress)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Revised RF2 and AMS opponent data handling to fix
      missing gap messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More work on AMS session end bugs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added better reporting of yellow flags for AMS and
      RF2 - the app will sometimes tell you who's involved in the
      incident and what corner the incident is in<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added simple incident reporting for known corners in
      R3E, AC and PCars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added attack / defend calls for known corners (note
      these messages don't play often - this is intentional)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added brake locking and wheel spin reporting for
      known corners<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* RF2 timing accuracy improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Assetto Corsa damage reporting<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Lots of minor bugfixes and improvements<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.1.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed AMS multi-class support and added some AMS car
      classes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Corrected AMS session end logic - should prevent
      session end messages playing until you complete your lap<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked AMS opponent lap time handling<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play 'chequered flag' message in race sessions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed messages not playing in unlimited timed
      sessions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some random bug fixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Sort the game list alphabetically for the
      hard-of-thinking<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.1.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed pcars timed sessions<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.1.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed broken personalisations (oops)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.1.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed broken settings preventing changes to any
      setting from being saved<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.1.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Integrated personalisations - the app will ask you
      to download a new "Personalisations" sound pack. When this is
      complete the "My name" drop down box (top right) has a long list
      of names the app can use when addressing you. This replaces the
      old method of manually unpacking a prefixes_and_suffixes folder to
      the app's sounds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Work-around for Assetto Corsa sometimes giving out
      of date position information<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disable multi-class code for RF1 based games because
      the vehicle type data from Automobilista is too vague (things like
      "Ford" and "Peugeot")<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Ported RF2 full course yellow and sector-specific
      yellow flag announcements to Automobilista<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Removed irrelvant pit window messages from RF1 based
      sims - in offline sessions, if a pit schedule is defined the app
      will call "box now" in accordance with this schedule (assuming
      equal stint lengths) - this can be disabled with
      enable_ams_pit_schedule_messages property<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed cut track warnings playing on out laps in
      Automobilista<br>
      <h4>Version 4.6.0.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Major overhaul of time reading (English sound pack -
      users of the Italian sound pack are unaffected)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added RF2 caution period and yellow flag events<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Scan for controllers only on request (press the
      "Scan for controllers" button to update the app's list of
      controllers) - this also improves the app's startup time<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed Assetto Corsa missing race start after 1.12
      patch<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added chequered flag message for timed sessions
      (still some issues here with PCars)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked PCars session end detection &nbsp;&nbsp;*
      added controller bindings for message volume up / down<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added some simple help text (much much more needs to
      be added to this)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Externalised car class definitions (first version -
      lots more work to do here)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Lots of bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.5.0.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* First cut of RF2 support, thanks to The Iron Wolf.
      This needs an additional .dll plugin for RF2 - see
https://forum.studio-397.com/index.php?threads/crew-chief-v4-5-with-rfactor-2-support.54421/<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Updated some Raceroom car classes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.4.3.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some controller cleanup tweaks<br>
      <h4>Version 4.4.3.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* R3E patch update<br>
      <h4>Version 4.4.2.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed controllers initialisation bug which should
      fix very slow (2-3 minutes) startup time for some users - thanks
      Tako<br>
      <h4>Version 4.4.2.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Removed some debug calls<br>
      <h4>Version 4.4.2.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Only cancel pre-lights messages on throttle
      application when using 'play_pre_lights_messages_until_cancelled'
      option<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to disable yellow flags in Assetto

      will play race session messages while you're on the grid until the
      throttle / brake / clutch is pressed, then it'll play the 'get
      ready' message. This can be enabled by selecting
      'play_pre_lights_messages_until_cancelled' option on the

      &nbsp;&nbsp;* First cut of Assetto Corsa support courtesy of
      Sparten - this is a work-in-progress<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added blue flag max trigger distance (increase this
      to make the blue flag warnings play when the lapping car is

      <h4>Version 4.2.1.7</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Use lastSectorTime and lapInvalidated data for
      opponent cars when in PCars UDP (network data) mode. This makes
      the opponent lap time reports accurate as the app doesn't have to
      time them itself (this data isn't available in PCars shared memory
      data). I recommend using UDP mode for PCars on PC, rather than
      shared memory<br>
      <h4>Version 4.2.1.6</h4>

      triggering 'keep him under pressure' messages too often<br>
      <h4>Version 4.2.1.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added support for secondary driver names mappings
      file 'additional_names.txt' so the auto-updater doesn't overwrite
      user-made changes to names.txt<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Additional validation on R3E sector reports<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added "what's the fastest lap" and "what time is it"
      voice commands (reports session best lap for player class, and
      current [real world] time of day)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A few bug fixes and minor improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked R3E tyre temperature checking to make
      better use of the core temps provided by the game (for new physics
      model cars)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.2.0.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added ADAC 2015 and F4 RaceRoom classes<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Damage reporting rework<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Various bug fixes and minor improvements<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play fuel messages while being refuelled<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play wheel spin / locking when in the pits or
      when we have a puncture or missing wheel<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed best lap and brake damage voice commands<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More frequent opponent gap reports on longer tracks<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added brake and tyre temp warning on pit exit (when
      temps aren't optimal) - these are optional (brake temp warning is
      on by default, tyre temp warning is off)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some voice commands now trigger a "stand by"
      response, then a few seconds later the actual response (optional,
      enabled by default - uses "enable_delayed_responses" property)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.6.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added Raceroom Formula Junior class<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Tweaked Raceroom engine damage thresholds<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Updated RaceRoom car classes to match new patch<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.6.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some TTS changes so the app should use Microsoft's
      David voice on Windows 10 (Windows 7 users are stuck with the
      execrable Anna)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some gamer tag to driver name extraction tweaks<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.6.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed crash bug when selecting 'alternate beeps'<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some Project Cars session restart detection changes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Work in progress text-to-speech for missing driver
      names<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added missing position messages for positions
      greater than 24<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.4.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Disable PCars pit window messages by default (can be
      re-enabled with the enable_pcars_pit_window_messages setting) -
      this only works correctly in offline races<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Revised some of the PCars session-end logic to
      reduce the likelihood of the app detecting a session restart when
      one hasn't actually taken place. This should also prevent the app
      from removing cached laptime data (which results in inaccurate
      'best lap' messages)<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.4.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More pit window logic fixes for PCars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play pre-lights messages in PCars when the

      issues - "Toggle" mode is now renamed "Press and release button"
      and actually works<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Read the sector times response as a single message
      per sector, to allow interrupting and fix an issue with the
      Italian number reader<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.4.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed missing sector 3 time being read as "zero
      tenths off the pace"<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.4.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reworked sector delta reporting to provide actual
      deltas, rather than approximations<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some changes to the Italian number reader (still
      work in progress)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.3.2</h4>

      a missing wheel or puncture<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play laptime improving / worsening messages if
      the conditions have significantly changed (rain or track temp)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play a message twice in succession if a player
      asks for something that the app was going to tell them anyway<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play good / OK start messages if the player
      has picked up a penalty (i.e. false start)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Insert a short pause between some messages<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Reduce the likelihood of multiple sweary messages
      being played in quick succession<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some better error trapping when the app is closed<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.2.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed radio channel (hold) button function for PCars
      network data<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.2.1</h4>

      for the PCars Lotus DLC<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed some pit detection issues in PCars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added option to enable spotter in hot lap (time
      trial) mode for PCars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't play lap time messages when we're in the pit
      lane<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't complain about worsening lap times if the
      player has made a pass on this lap<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.2.0</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Major speech recognizer overhaul to allow user
      customisation (and translation) - see

      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Externalised all UI text - see
      [installDir]/ui_text.txt for details<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added some options to number reading - see
      [installDir]/sounds_config.txt for details<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixes to Hot Lap (timetrial) mode in PCars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Don't trigger flags event when stationary<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A couple of internal bug fixes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.1.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added some car classes and Bannockbrae track for
      PCars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Remove stale opponents in PCars<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Some internal error handling<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.1.3</h4>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Take start position into account when generating
      race end message<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* A couple of internal bug fixes<br>

      sounds work a little better<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.0.2</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Renamed UDP network button data option to make it
      clearer that this takes button presses from the UDP stream, rather
      than from the device directly<br>
      <h4>Version 4.1.0.1</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* More internal fixes to the radio channel handling
      logic to handle a couple of edge-cases where it wasn't closing the

      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Added support for personalised message prefixes and
      suffixes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Spotter fix - reinstated missing width separation
      check to prevent spotter calls being made when a car is directly
      in front / behind but within the car length parameter<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Internal audio handling overhaul - better queue
      handling, more reliable radio channel state management (should
      prevent channel being left open)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed number reading for some numbers<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed DTM 2014 tyre compound error in the 'box now'
      message<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Validate overtake messages to ensure they're not out
      of date by the time they're played<br>
      <h4>Version 4.0.3.5</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixed major regression for Project Cars - hold all
      internal Strings as raw byte arrays (which may or may not have a
      null first character) and decode them when we need them<br>
      <h4>Version 4.0.3.4</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Internal rework for Project Cars to handle String
      data which occasionally starts with a null character. Should fix
      'missing' opponents and incorrect car classes<br>
      <h4>Version 4.0.3.3</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;* Major spotter overhaul - changed the way app
      calculates opponent speeds, much more accurate. Should make a
      difference to the ghost calls<br>
